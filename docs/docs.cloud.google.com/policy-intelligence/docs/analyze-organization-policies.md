title: Analyze organization policies
description: Policy Analyzer for Organization Policy allows you to analyze your organization policy configurations throughout your resource hierarchy.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

This page contains information about analyzing your organization policy settings to see which resources are covered by which organization policy. Using Policy Analyzer for Organization Policy, you can create an analysis query to get information on both custom and predefined organization policies.

An analysis query is composed of a scope and a constraint.

  - Constraint: specifies the resource name of a constraint.

  - Scope: specifies an organization to scope the analysis. All organization policies with the specified constraint defined in this scope are included in the analysis.

  - For more information about organization policies, see the [Introduction to the Organization Policy Service](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview) .

  - For more information about how to create custom constraints, see [Creating and managing custom constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-custom-constraints) .

  - For more information about managed constraints, see [Using constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/using-constraints#managed-constraints) .

## Before you begin

  - Enable the Cloud Asset API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    You must enable the API in the project you will use to send the query. This doesn't have to be the same resource that you scope your query to.

  - Optional: If you want to execute more than 20 policy analysis queries per organization per day, ensure that you have an [organization-level activation of the Premium or Enterprise tier of Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/pricing#organization-level-activations) . For more information, see [Billing questions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/billing-questions) .

### Required roles and permissions

To get the permissions that you need to run an organization policy analysis, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the organization resource in which you want to conduct your analysis:

  - To conduct the analysis: [Cloud Asset Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudasset#cloudasset.viewer) ( `roles/cloudasset.viewer` )
  - To view constraints: [Organization Policy Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/orgpolicy#orgpolicy.policyViewer) ( `roles/orgpolicy.policyViewer` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to run an organization policy analysis. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to run an organization policy analysis:

  - To conduct the analysis:
      - `cloudasset.assets.analyzeOrgPolicy`
      - `cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources`
      - `cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies`
  - To view custom and managed constraints: `orgpolicy.customConstraints.get`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Pricing and quota

Policy Analyzer for Organization Policy at scale (above 20 queries per organization per day) and [inheritance visualizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-organization-policies#visualize_inheritance) are only available for customers with [organization-level activations of Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/pricing#organization-level-activations) .

Quota for Policy Analyzer for Organization Policy is shared among all Policy Analyzer tools. For more information, see [Billing questions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/billing-questions) .

## Analyze configured policies

An organization policy is built from a constraint and optional conditions under which that constraint is enforced. You can use Policy Analyzer to return a list of organization policies with a particular constraint and the resources to which those policies are attached.

For each organization policy that is detected in the query's scope, Policy Analyzer returns a result entry. A result entry contains the following fields:

  - `consolidatedPolicy` : the resource to which the organization policy is attached, and the effective policy enforcement on that resource with respect to [hierarchy evaluation rules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/understanding-hierarchy) .

  - `project` : the ID of the project resource to which this consolidated policy belongs.

  - `folders` : the ID of any folder resources that are ancestors of the resource to which the organization policy is attached.

  - `organization` : the ID of the organization resource that is the ancestor of the resource to which the organization policy is attached.

  - `policyBundle` : the full configured organization policy attached to the above resource, and the organization policies defined on its ancestors in the resource hierarchy.

If your resources are protected by a VPC Service Controls service perimeter, you must create an [egress rule](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/ingress-egress-rules) in the perimeter of your organization resource that allows access to the `cloudasset.googleapis.com` service and the `google.cloud.asset.v1.AssetService.SearchAllResources` method. If you don't have an egress rule, the request will fail with a `NETWORK_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER` error. For more information, see [Debugging requests blocked by VPC Service Controls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/troubleshooting#debugging) .

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Policy Analyzer** page.

2.  In the **Analyze organization policy** section, find the pane labeled **Where are specific organization policies configured?** and click **Create query** in that pane.

3.  In the **Select query organization** box, select the organization for which you want to analyze organization policies.

4.  Select the type of constraint you want to analyze. For a predefined or managed constraint, select **Built-in constraint** . For a custom constraint, select **Custom constraint** .

5.  Enter the name of the constraint you want to analyze. The prefix for the type of constraint you are analyzing is already included. For example, for the predefined domain restriction constraint, enter `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` , for the service account creation managed constraint, enter `iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` , and for a custom constraint, enter its name, such as `disableGkeAutoUpgrade` .

6.  Click **Analyze** , and then **Run query** . The report page shows the query parameters you entered, and a results table of all resources to which this constraint is directly applied.

7.  You can save this query to view again later by clicking **Copy query URL** . To view this query, navigate to the generated URL.

8.  You can visualize the inheritance of the constraint you analyzed by selecting at least one resource from the list, and then clicking **View inheritance** . You can also immediately go to the visualization view when you create your analysis query by clicking **Analyze** and then **Visualize** . See [Visualize inheritance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-organization-policies#visualize_inheritance) for more information.

### gcloud

To get an analysis of how an organization policy constraint is enforced within an organization, use the [`gcloud asset analyze-org-policies` command](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/asset/analyze-org-policies) :

    gcloud asset analyze-org-policies \
        --constraint=CONSTRAINT_NAME  \
        --scope=organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID \
        --limit=LIMIT_POLICIES \
        --filter=FILTER_QUERY

Replace the following:

  - CONSTRAINT\_NAME : the name of the organization policy constraint you want to analyze. For a list of constraints, see [Organization policy constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) .

  - ORGANIZATION\_ID : the ID of your organization resource. For more information about finding your organization ID, see [Creating and managing organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) .

  - LIMIT\_POLICIES : the number of result entries you want to view. To see unlimited entries, enter `unlimited` .

  - FILTER\_QUERY : a filter query to see only policies that match your filtering expression. The only available field for filtering is `consolidated_policy.attached_resource` . For example, `consolidated_policy.attached_resource="//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/1234567890"` would only return policies that were attached to the project with the project ID `1234567890` .

The YAML response is similar to the following:

#### Sample YAML response

### REST

To get an analysis of how an organization policy constraint is enforced within an organization, use the Cloud Asset API's [`analyzeOrgPolicies` method](https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/reference/rest/v1/TopLevel/analyzeOrgPolicies) .

HTTP method and URL:

    GET https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID:analyzeOrgPolicies

Request JSON body:

    JSON_REQUEST="{
      'constraint': 'CONSTRAINT_NAME',
      'filter': 'FILTER_QUERY',
      'page_size': PAGE_SIZE,
      'page_token': PAGE_TOKEN
    }"

Replace the following:

  - ORGANIZATION\_ID : the ID of your organization resource. For more information about finding your organization ID, see [Creating and managing organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) .

  - CONSTRAINT\_NAME : the name of the organization policy constraint you want to analyze. For a list of constraints, see [Organization policy constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) .

  - FILTER\_QUERY : a filter query to see only policies that match your filtering expression. The only available field for filtering is `consolidated_policy.attached_resource` . For example, `consolidated_policy.attached_resource="//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/1234567890"` would only return policies that were attached to the project with the project ID `1234567890` .

  - PAGE\_SIZE : the number of result entries per page you want to view. To see unlimited entries, enter `unlimited` . A request made with this flag set returns a `nextPageToken` value if the total number of result entries is greater than the PAGE\_SIZE .

  - PAGE\_TOKEN : only to be set on requests after the first request that includes the `page_size` flag. You can use the `nextPageToken` values received from previous responses to return a particular page of results.

The JSON response is similar to the following:

## Analyze containers

A container in this context is a project, folder, or organization resource. You can use Policy Analyzer to return a list of all containers that have organization policies with a particular constraint enforced on them. Policy Analyzer also returns the full name of each container, the container's parent in the hierarchy, and the tags inherited by or attached to the container.

For each container that is detected in the query's scope, Policy Analyzer returns a result entry. A result entry contains the following fields:

  - `consolidatedPolicy` : the container to which the organization policy is attached, and the effective policy enforcement on that container with respect to [hierarchy evaluation rules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/understanding-hierarchy) .

  - `conditionEvaluation` : if the included conditions result in enforcement of the organization policy, `evaluationValue` is `TRUE` . If the conditions result in the organization policy not being enforced, `evaluationValue` is `FALSE` . If the condition is not supported by one or more of the resources on which the organization policy is enforced, the condition itself is returned.

  - `effectiveTags` : all tags that are directly attached to or inherited by the container and the container's parents in the hierarchy.

  - `folders` : the ID of any folder resources that contain the container to which the organization policy is attached.

  - `fullResourceName` : the full name of the container.

  - `organization` : the ID of the organization resource that is the ancestor of the container to which the organization policy is attached.

  - `parent` : the full resource name of the parent of this container.

  - `policyBundle` : the organization policy configured directly on the container, if one exists, and the organization policies defined on the ancestors of the container in the resource hierarchy.

  - `project` : the ID of the container to which the organization policy is attached, if it is a project resource.

If your resources are protected by a VPC Service Controls service perimeter, you must create an [egress rule](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/ingress-egress-rules) in the perimeter of your organization resource that allows access to the `cloudasset.googleapis.com` service and the `google.cloud.asset.v1.AssetService.SearchAllResources` method. If you don't have an egress rule, the request will fail with a `NETWORK_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER` error. For more information, see [Debugging requests blocked by VPC Service Controls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/troubleshooting#debugging) .

  - CONSTRAINT\_NAME : the name of the organization policy constraint you want to analyze. For a list of constraints, see [Organization policy constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) .

  - ORGANIZATION\_ID : the ID of your organization resource. For more information about finding your organization ID, see [Creating and managing organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) .

  - LIMIT\_CONTAINERS : the number of result entries you want to view. To see unlimited entries, enter `unlimited` .

  - FILTER\_QUERY : a filter query to see only containers that match your filtering expression. The only available field for filtering is `parent` . For example, `parent="//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/012345678901"` would only return containers that were children of the organization with the organization ID `012345678901` .

The YAML response is similar to the following:

  - PAGE\_SIZE : the number of pages of result entries you want to view. To see unlimited entries, enter `unlimited` . A request made with this flag set returns a `nextPageToken` value if the total number of result entries is greater than the PAGE\_SIZE .

  - PAGE\_TOKEN : only to be set on requests after the first request that includes the `page_size` flag. You can use the `nextPageToken` values received from previous responses to return a particular page of results.

The JSON response is similar to the following:

## Analyze assets

An asset in this context is a Google Cloud resource or Identity and Access Management (IAM) allow policy. You can use Policy Analyzer to return a list of all assets that have organization policies with a particular constraint enforced on them. Custom constraints, managed constraints, and the following predefined constraints are supported:

  - `constraints/ainotebooks.accessMode`
  - `constraints/ainotebooks.disableFileDownloads`
  - `constraints/ainotebooks.disableRootAccess`
  - `constraints/ainotebooks.disableTerminal`
  - `constraints/ainotebooks.environmentOptions`
  - `constraints/ainotebooks.requireAutoUpgradeSchedule`
  - `constraints/ainotebooks.restrictVpcNetworks`
  - `constraints/compute.disableGuestAttributesAccess`
  - `constraints/compute.disableInstanceDataAccessApis`
  - `constraints/compute.disableNestedVirtualization`
  - `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess`
  - `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging`
  - `constraints/compute.disableVpcExternalIpv6`
  - `constraints/compute.requireOsLogin`
  - `constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm`
  - `constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes`
  - `constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes`
  - `constraints/compute.restrictXpnProjectLienRemoval`
  - `constraints/compute.setNewProjectDefaultToZonalDNSOnly`
  - `constraints/compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation`
  - `constraints/compute.trustedImageProjects`
  - `constraints/compute.vmCanIpForward`
  - `constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess`
  - `constraints/gcp.detailedAuditLoggingMode`
  - `constraints/gcp.resourceLocations`
  - `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`
  - `constraints/iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts`
  - `constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation`
  - `constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`
  - `constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload`
  - `constraints/iam.restrictCrossProjectServiceAccountLienRemoval`
  - `constraints/iam.serviceAccountKeyExpiryHours`
  - `constraints/resourcemanager.accessBoundaries`
  - `constraints/resourcemanager.allowedExportDestinations`
  - `constraints/sql.restrictAuthorizedNetworks`
  - `constraints/sql.restrictNoncompliantDiagnosticDataAccess`
  - `constraints/sql.restrictNoncompliantResourceCreation`
  - `constraints/sql.restrictPublicIp`
  - `constraints/storage.publicAccessPrevention`
  - `constraints/storage.restrictAuthTypes`
  - `constraints/storage.uniformBucketLevelAccess`

Policy Analyzer returns the full name of each asset, the asset's parent in the hierarchy, and any ancestor project, folder, and organization resources above the asset in the hierarchy.

For each asset that is detected in the query's scope, Policy Analyzer returns a result entry.

A result entry for a resource contains the following fields:

  - `consolidatedPolicy` : the resource to which the organization policy is attached, and the effective policy enforcement on that resource with respect to [hierarchy evaluation rules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/understanding-hierarchy) .

  - `conditionEvaluation` : if the included conditions result in enforcement of the organization policy, `evaluationValue` is `TRUE` . If the conditions result in the organization policy not being enforced, `evaluationValue` is `FALSE` . If the condition is not supported by one or more of the resources on which the organization policy is enforced, the condition itself is returned.

  - `assetType` : the resource type of the asset.

  - `effectiveTags` : all tags that are directly attached to or inherited by the resource to which the organization policy is attached and the resource's parents in the hierarchy.

  - `folders` : the ID of any folder resources that contain the resource to which the organization policy is attached.

  - `fullResourceName` : the full resource name of the resource.

  - `organization` : the relative resource name of the organization that contains the resource.

  - `parent` : the full resource name of the parent of the resource.

  - `project` : the ID of the project that contains the resource.

  - `policyBundle` : the full configured organization policy attached to the above resource, and the organization policies defined on its ancestors in the resource hierarchy.

A result entry for an allow policy contains the following fields:

  - `consolidatedPolicy` : the resource to which the organization policy is attached, and the effective policy enforcement on that resource with respect to [hierarchy evaluation rules](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/understanding-hierarchy) .

  - `assetType` : the resource type of the resource to which the allow policy is attached.

  - `attachedResource` : the full name of the resource to which the allow policy is attached.

  - `folders` : the relative resource name of any folders that contain the allow policy.

  - `organization` : the relative resource name of the organization that contains the allow policy.

  - `policy` : the allow policy.

  - `project` : the relative resource name of the project that contains the allow policy.

  - `policyBundle` : the full configured organization policy attached to the above resource, and the organization policies defined on its ancestors in the resource hierarchy.

If your resources are protected by a VPC Service Controls service perimeter, you must create an [egress rule](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/ingress-egress-rules) in the perimeter of your organization resource that allows access to the `cloudasset.googleapis.com` service and the `google.cloud.asset.v1.AssetService.SearchAllResources` method. If you don't have an egress rule, the request will fail with a `NETWORK_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER` error. For more information, see [Debugging requests blocked by VPC Service Controls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/troubleshooting#debugging) .

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Policy Analyzer** page.

2.  In the **Analyze organization policy** section, find the pane labeled **Which resources are affected by an organization policy constraint?** and click **Create query** in that pane.

3.  In the **Select query organization** box, select the organization for which you want to analyze organization policies.

4.  Select the type of constraint you want to analyze. For a predefined or managed constraint, select **Built-in constraint** . For a custom constraint, select **Custom constraint** .

5.  Enter the name of the constraint you want to analyze. The prefix for the type of constraint you are analyzing is already included. For example, for the predefined bucket-level access constraint, enter `storage.uniformBucketLevelAccess` , for the service account creation managed constraint, enter `iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` , and for a custom constraint, enter its name, such as `disableGkeAccess` .

6.  Click **Run query** . The report page shows the query parameters you entered, and a results table of all assets that this constraint is enforced on or inherited by.

7.  You can save this query to view again later by clicking **Copy query URL** . To view this query, navigate to the generated URL.

8.  You can visualize the inheritance of the constraint you analyzed by selecting at least one asset from the list, and then clicking **View inheritance** . You can also immediately go to the visualization view when you create your analysis query by clicking **Analyze** and then **Visualize** . See [Visualize inheritance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-organization-policies#visualize_inheritance) for more information.

### gcloud

To get an analysis of how an organization policy constraint is enforced on assets within an organization, use the [`gcloud asset analyze-org-policy-governed-assets` command](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/asset/analyze-org-policy-governed-assets) :

    gcloud asset analyze-org-policy-governed-assets \
        --constraint=CONSTRAINT_NAME  \
        --scope=organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID \
        --limit=LIMIT_ASSETS \
        --filter=FILTER_QUERY

Replace the following:

  - CONSTRAINT\_NAME : the name of the organization policy constraint you want to analyze. For a list of constraints, see [Organization policy constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) .

  - ORGANIZATION\_ID : the ID of your organization resource. For more information about finding your organization ID, see [Creating and managing organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) .

  - LIMIT\_ASSETS : the number of result entries you want to view. To see unlimited entries, enter `unlimited` .

  - FILTER\_QUERY : a filter query to see only assets that match your filtering expression. The available fields for filtering are `governed_resource.folders` , `governed_resource.project` , `governed_iam_policy.folders` , and `governed_iam_policy.project` . For example, `governed_resource.project="projects/1234567890"` would only return assets that were attached to the project with the project ID `1234567890` .

The YAML response is similar to the following:

### REST

To get an analysis of how an organization policy constraint is enforced on assets within an organization, use the Cloud Asset API's [`analyzeOrgPolicyGovernedAssets` method](https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/reference/rest/v1/TopLevel/analyzeOrgPolicyGovernedAssets) .

HTTP method and URL:

    GET https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID:analyzeOrgPolicyGovernedAssets

Request JSON body:

    JSON_REQUEST="{
      'constraint': 'CONSTRAINT_NAME',
      'filter': 'FILTER_QUERY',
      'page_size': PAGE_SIZE,
      'page_token': PAGE_TOKEN
    }"

Replace the following:

  - ORGANIZATION\_ID : the ID of your organization resource. For more information about finding your organization ID, see [Creating and managing organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) .

  - CONSTRAINT\_NAME : the name of the organization policy constraint you want to analyze. For a list of constraints, see [Organization policy constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) .

  - FILTER\_QUERY : a filter query to see only assets that match your filtering expression. The available fields for filtering are `governed_resource.folders` , `governed_resource.project` , `governed_iam_policy.folders` , and `governed_iam_policy.project` . For example, `governed_resource.project="projects/1234567890"` would only return assets that were attached to the project with the project ID `1234567890` .

  - PAGE\_SIZE : the number of pages of result entries you want to view. To see unlimited entries, enter `unlimited` . A request made with this flag set returns a `nextPageToken` value if the total number of result entries is greater than the PAGE\_SIZE .

  - PAGE\_TOKEN : only to be set on requests after the first request that includes the `page_size` flag. You can use the `nextPageToken` values received from previous responses to return a particular page of results.

The JSON response is similar to the following:

## Visualize inheritance

If you have an [organization-level activation of the Premium or Enterprise tier of Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/pricing#security-command-center-pricing) , you can visualize the inheritance of organization policies you have analyzed using the Google Cloud console.

To view the inheritance visualization, create an organization policy analysis query for [configured policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-organization-policies#analyze_policies) , [containers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-organization-policies#analyze_containers) , or [assets](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-organization-policies#analyze_assets) . On the **Run query analysis** page, click **Analyze** , and then select **Visualize** .

You can also navigate to the URL of a saved query, select the resources you want to highlight, and then click lan **View inheritance** .

The **Resource inheritance** page shows a visualization of the resource hierarchy for the resources selected in your analysis query:

![Visualization of organization policy inheritance in a resource hierarchy.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/analyzer-visualization-hierarchy.png) ![Visualization of an unenforced boolean policy.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/analyzer-visualization-boolean.png)

1.  Indicates if the resource is an organization, folder, or project.

2.  A blue dot indicates the resource is selected in the query.

3.  Indicates the resource overrides the policy of its parent resource.

4.  Indicates the resource resets the organization policy to the Google-managed default for that policy. A resource that resets the policy to default has a dotted line connecting it to its parent.

5.  Indicates the resource merges policy with its parent.

6.  Indicates that the organization policy on this resource enforces a either a boolean constraint that is enforced, or a list constraint with allowed values.

7.  Indicates that the organization policy on this resource is a list constraint with denied values.

8.  Indicates that the organization policy on this resource is a boolean constraint that is not enforced.
