description: Instructions for creating, managing, and running saved Policy Analyzer queries.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

This page shows you how to create, manage, and run saved [Policy Analyzer queries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-iam-policies) . You can create up to 200 saved queries on an asset. This limit does not include the saved queries of its children. For example, if you have 10 projects under an organization, each project can have up to 200 saved queries and the organization can have up to 200 saved queries.

## Before you begin

1.  Enable the Cloud Asset API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to create and manage saved queries, ask your administrator to grant you the [Cloud Asset Owner](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudasset#cloudasset.owner) ( `roles/cloudasset.owner` ) IAM role on the project, folder, or organization that you will save your query to. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create and manage saved queries. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create and manage saved queries:

  - `cloudasset.savedqueries.create`
  - `cloudasset.savedqueries.delete`
  - `cloudasset.savedqueries.get`
  - `cloudasset.savedqueries.list`
  - `cloudasset.savedqueries.update`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Create a saved query

### gcloud

To create a saved Policy Analyzer query in a parent project, folder, or organization, use the `gcloud asset saved-queries create` command.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  SCOPE_RESOURCE_TYPE_PLURAL  ` : The type of the resource that you want to scope your search to, in plural form. Only IAM allow policies attached to this resource and to its descendants will be analyzed. Use the value `projects` , `folders` , or `organizations` .
  - `  SCOPE_RESOURCE_ID  ` : The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to scope your search to. Only IAM allow policies attached to this resource and to its descendants will be analyzed. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .
  - `  FULL_RESOURCE_NAME  ` : Optional. The full resource name of the resource that you want to analyze access for. For a list of full resource name formats, see [Resource name format](https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) .
  - `  PRINCIPAL  ` : Optional. The principal whose access you want to analyze, in the form `  PRINCIPAL_TYPE : ID  ` —for example, `user:my-user@example.com` . For a full list of the principal types, see [Principal identifiers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-identifiers) .
  - `  PERMISSION_1  ` , `  PERMISSION_2  ` ... `  PERMISSION_N  ` : Optional. The permissions that you want to check for—for example, `compute.instances.get` . If you list multiple permissions, Policy Analyzer will check for any of the permissions listed.
  - `  QUERY_ID  ` : The ID to use for the saved query, which must be unique in the specified parent resource (project, folder, or organization). You can use letters, numbers, and hyphens in the query ID.
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : The resource type that you want to save a query for. Use the value `project` , `folder` , or `organization` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to save a query for. Project IDs can be alphanumeric or numeric. Folder and organization IDs are numeric.
  - `  LABEL_KEY  ` and `  LABEL_VALUE  ` : Optional. A comma-separated list of key/value pairs to attach to the query, which can be used in search and list operations. You can include up to 10 labels for each saved query.
  - `  DESCRIPTION  ` : Optional. A string describing the query.

Save the following content in a file called `request.json` :

    {
      "IamPolicyAnalysisQuery": {
        "scope": "SCOPE_RESOURCE_TYPE_PLURAL/SCOPE_RESOURCE_ID",
        "resourceSelector": {
          "fullResourceName": "FULL_RESOURCE_NAME"

            "PERMISSION_2",
            "PERMISSION_N"
          ]
        }
      }
    }

Execute the following command:
