title: Write policy analysis to BigQuery
description: Instructions for analyzing IAM policies asynchronously and writing the results to BigQuery.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

This page explains how to analyze Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies asynchronously and write results to BigQuery. The process is similar to [analyzing IAM policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-iam-policies) except the analysis result is written to [BigQuery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery) tables.

## Before you begin

Enable the Cloud Asset API.

**Roles required to enable APIs**

To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You must enable the API in the project you will use to send the query. This doesn't have to be the same resource that you scope your query to.

## Required roles and permissions

The following roles and permissions are required to run a policy analysis and export the results to BigQuery.

### Required IAM roles

To get the permissions that you need to analyze a policy and export the results to BigQuery, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project, folder, or organization that you will scope your query to:

  - [BigQuery Data Editor](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataEditor) ( `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` )
  - [Cloud Asset Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudasset#cloudasset.viewer) ( `roles/cloudasset.viewer` )
  - To analyze policies with [custom IAM roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) : [Role Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.roleViewer) ( `roles/iam.roleViewer` )
  - To use the Google Cloud CLI to analyze policies: [Service Usage Consumer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/serviceusage#serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer) ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to analyze a policy and export the results to BigQuery. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to analyze a policy and export the results to BigQuery:

  - `bigquery.datasets.create`
  - `bigquery.jobs.create`
  - `bigquery.tables.create`
  - `bigquery.tables.get`
  - `bigquery.tables.updateData`
  - `bigquery.tables.update`
  - `cloudasset.assets.analyzeIamPolicy`
  - `cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources`
  - `cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies`
  - To analyze policies with custom IAM roles: `iam.roles.get`
  - To use the Google Cloud CLI to analyze policies: `serviceusage.services.use`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

### Required Google Workspace permissions

If you want to see if a principal has certain roles or permissions as a result of their membership in a Google Workspace group, you need the `groups.read` Google Workspace permission. This permission is contained in the Groups Reader Admin role, and in more powerful roles such as the Groups Admin or Super Admin roles. See [Assign specific admin roles](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9807615) for more information.

## Analyze policies and export results

<span id="calling_analyzeiampolicylongrunning"></span>

<span id="calling_analyzeiampolicylongrunning"></span>

### Console

1.  <span id="calling_analyzeiampolicylongrunning"></span>
    
    In the Google Cloud console, go to the Policy Analyzer page.
    
    <span id="calling_analyzeiampolicylongrunning"></span>

2.  In the **Analyze policies** section, find the query template you want to use, then click **Create query** . If you want to create a custom query, click **Create custom query** .

3.  In the **Select query scope** field, select the project, folder, or organization that you want to scope the query to. Policy Analyzer will analyze access for that project, folder, or organization, as well as any resources within that project, folder, or organization.

4.  Ensure that your query parameters are set:
    
      - If you're using a query template, confirm the prefilled query parameters.
      - If you're creating a custom query, set the resources, principals, roles, and permissions that you want to query for.
    
    For more information about the types of queries you can create, see [Analyze IAM policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/analyze-iam-policies) .

5.  In the pane labeled with the name of the query, click **Analyze \> Export result only** . The **Export results** pane opens.

6.  In the **Set export destination** section, enter the following information:
    
      - **Project** : The project where your BigQuery dataset is located.
      - **Dataset** : The BigQuery dataset that you want to export results to.
      - **Table** : The prefix of the BigQuery tables to which the analysis results will be written. If a table with the specified prefix doesn't exist, BigQuery creates a new table.

7.  Click **Continue** .

8.  Optional: In the **Configure additional settings** section, select the options you want:
    
      - **Partitioning** : Whether to partition the table. To learn more about partitioned tables, see [Introduction to partitioned tables](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) .
      - **Write preference** : Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table or partition already exists. By default, if the table or partition already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table or the latest partition.

9.  Click **Export** .

Policy Analyzer runs your query and exports the results to the specified table.

### gcloud

The [`AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/reference/rest/v1/TopLevel/analyzeIamPolicyLongrunning) method allows you to issue an analysis request and get results in the specified [BigQuery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery) destination.

## View IAM policy analysis results

To view your IAM policy analysis results:

<span id="viewing_policy_analysis_results"></span>

<span id="viewing_policy_analysis_results"></span>

### Console

1.  <span id="viewing_policy_analysis_results"></span>
    
    In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.
    
    <span id="viewing_policy_analysis_results"></span>

2.  To display the tables and views in the dataset, open the navigation panel. In the **Explorer** section, select your project to expand it, and then select a dataset.

3.  From the list, select the tables with your prefix. The table with an `analysis` suffix contains the query and metadata (for example, operation name, request time, and non-critical errors). The table with `analysis_result` suffix is the result listing tuples of `{identity, role(s)/permission(s), resource}` together with IAM policies that generate those tuples.

4.  To view a sample set of data, select the **Preview** tab.

### API

To browse your table's data, call [`tabledata.list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tabledata/list) . In the `tableId` parameter, specify the name of your table.

You can configure the following optional parameters to control the output.

  - `maxResults` is the maximum number of results to return.
  - `selectedFields` is a comma-separated list of columns to return; If unspecified, all columns are returned.
  - `startIndex` is the zero-based index of the starting row to read.

> **Note:** If you request a `startIndex` beyond the last row, the method returns successfully but without a `rows` property. You can find out how many rows are in your table by calling the [`tables.get`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/get) method and examining the `numRows` property.

Values are returned wrapped in a JSON object that you must parse, as described in the [`tabledata.list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tabledata/list) reference documentation.

<span id="querying"></span>

<span id="querying"></span>

## Query BigQuery

<span id="querying">This section provides example SQL queries to show you how to use BigQuery tables written by `AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning` . For more information on BigQuery syntax, see</span> [Standard SQL Query Syntax](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) .

OP\_ID is needed for most queries, you can get it from [`AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/reference/rest/v1/TopLevel/analyzeIamPolicyLongrunning) response. For example, in gcloud, You will find OP\_ID is `123456` in "Use `[gcloud asset operations describe organizations/123456789/operations/AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning/123456]` to check the status of the operation.".

### List Operations

Your table could store results of multiple `AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning` operations. You can use the following query to list all of them:

    SELECT DISTINCT
      requestTime,
      opName
    FROM `BQ_PROJECT_ID.BQ_DATASET_NAME.BQ_TABLE_PREFIX_analysis`
    ORDER BY 1 DESC
    ;

### List Analyses in one Operation

In one `AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning` operation, there could be multiple analysis records generated. For example, when you enable the `analyze_service_account_impersonation` option in your request, the result could contain one main analysis (with analysisId 0) and several service account impersonation analysis.

You can use the following query to find out all analysis by giving an operation name.

    DECLARE _opName STRING DEFAULT "organizations/ORG_ID/operations/AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning/OP_ID";
    
    SELECT
      analysisId,
      requestTime,
      TO_JSON_STRING(analysis.analysisQuery, true) as analysisQuery,
      analysis.fullyExplored,
      TO_JSON_STRING(analysis.nonCriticalErrors, true) as nonCriticalErrors
    FROM `BQ_PROJECT_ID.BQ_DATASET_NAME.BQ_TABLE_PREFIX_analysis`
    WHERE opName=_opName
    ORDER BY 1
    ;

### List ACEs(Access Control Entries) in one Analysis

An ACE is an Access Control Entry `{identity, role(s)/permission(s), resource}` . You can use the following query to list ACE in one analysis.

    DECLARE _opName STRING DEFAULT "organizations/ORG_ID/operations/AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning/OP_ID";
    
    SELECT DISTINCT
      ids.name AS identity,
      resources.fullResourceName AS resource,
      accesses.role AS role,
      accesses.permission AS permission
    FROM `BQ_PROJECT_ID.BQ_DATASET_NAME.BQ_TABLE_PREFIX_analysis_result`,
      UNNEST(analysisResult.identityList.identities) AS ids,
      UNNEST(analysisResult.accessControlLists) AS acls,
      UNNEST(acls.accesses) AS accesses,
      UNNEST(acls.resources) AS resources
    WHERE opName=_opName
    AND analysisId = 0
    ORDER BY 1,2,3,4
    ;

### List ACEs(Access Control Entries) with IAM policy binding in one Analysis

In this query, we list both ACE and the IAM policy binding that generates this ACE for one analysis.

    DECLARE _opName STRING DEFAULT "organizations/ORG_ID/operations/AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning/OP_ID";
    
    SELECT
      ids.name AS identity,
      resources.fullResourceName AS resource,
      accesses.role AS role,
      accesses.permission AS permission,
      analysisResult.attachedResourceFullName as iam_policy_attached_resource,
      TO_JSON_STRING(analysisResult.iamBinding, true) as iam_policy_binding
    FROM `BQ_PROJECT_ID.BQ_DATASET_NAME.BQ_TABLE_PREFIX_analysis_result`,
      UNNEST(analysisResult.identityList.identities) AS ids,
      UNNEST(analysisResult.accessControlLists) AS acls,
      UNNEST(acls.accesses) AS accesses,
      UNNEST(acls.resources) AS resources
    WHERE opName=_opName AND analysisId = 0
    ORDER BY 1,2,3,4
    ;

### List IAM policy bindings in one Analysis

In this query, we list the IAM policy bindings appeared in one analysis.

    DECLARE _opName STRING DEFAULT "organizations/ORG_ID/operations/AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning/OP_ID";
    
    SELECT DISTINCT
      analysisResult.attachedResourceFullName as iam_policy_attached_resource,
      TO_JSON_STRING(analysisResult.iamBinding, true) as iam_policy_binding
    FROM `BQ_PROJECT_ID.BQ_DATASET_NAME.BQ_TABLE_PREFIX_analysis_result`
    WHERE opName=_opName AND analysisId = 0
    ORDER BY 1, 2
    ;

### List IAM policy bindings with ACE(Access Control Entry) in one Analysis

In this query, we list the IAM policy bindings with their derived ACEs in one analysis

    DECLARE _opName STRING DEFAULT "organizations/ORG_ID/operations/AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning/OP_ID";
    
    SELECT
      analysisResult.attachedResourceFullName as iam_policy_attached_resource,
      TO_JSON_STRING(analysisResult.iamBinding, true) as iam_policy_binding,
      TO_JSON_STRING(analysisResult.identityList.identities, true) as identities,
      TO_JSON_STRING(acls.accesses, true) as accesses,
      TO_JSON_STRING(acls.resources, true) as resources
    FROM `BQ_PROJECT_ID.BQ_DATASET_NAME.BQ_TABLE_PREFIX_analysis_result`,
      UNNEST(analysisResult.accessControlLists) AS acls
    WHERE opName=_opName AND analysisId = 0
    ORDER BY 1,2
    ;
