description: Instructions for reviewing and applying role recommendations for Cloud Storage buckets.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

This page explains how to view, understand, and apply IAM role recommendations for Cloud Storage buckets. Role recommendations help you enforce the principle of least privilege by ensuring that principals have only the permissions that they actually need.

## Before you begin

  - Enable the IAM and Recommender APIs.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

  - Ensure that you have an organization-level or project-level activation of [the Premium or Enterprise tier of Security Command Center](https://docs.cloud.google.com/security-command-center/pricing#security-command-center-pricing) . For more information, see [Billing questions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/billing-questions) .

  - Understand [role recommendations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview) .

  - Set up authentication.
    
    Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
    
    ### Console
    
    When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
    
    ### gcloud
    
    In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
    
    ### REST
    
    To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
    
    For more information, see [Authenticate for using REST](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/rest) in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

### Required IAM roles

To get the permissions that you need to manage bucket-level role recommendations, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project:

  - [Role Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.roleViewer) ( `roles/iam.roleViewer` )
  - [Storage Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/storage#storage.admin) ( `roles/storage.admin` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to manage bucket-level role recommendations. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to manage bucket-level role recommendations:

  - To view recommendations:
      - `iam.roles.get`
      - `iam.roles.list`
      - `recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.get`
      - `recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.list`
      - `recommender.iamPolicyInsights.get`
      - `recommender.iamPolicyInsights.list`
      - `storage.buckets.getIamPolicy`
  - To apply and dismiss recommendations:
      - `recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.update`
      - `storage.buckets.setIamPolicy`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Review and apply recommendations

You can review and apply bucket-level role recommendations with the Google Cloud CLI and the Recommender API.

> **Note:** The IAM recommender does not take other forms of access controls into account when making recommendations. If you use access controls that are separate from IAM, such as Cloud Storage [access control lists (ACLs)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists) or Kubernetes [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control) , ensure that each recommendation will not disrupt those access controls before you apply the recommendation.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage **Buckets** page.

2.  Find the **Security insights** column. If the column is not visible, click **Column display options** view\_column and select **Security insights** .
    
    The **Security insights** column shows a summary of all policy insights for a bucket. Each summary indicates the total number of excess permissions for all roles granted on that bucket.
    
    ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/storage-bucket-table.png)
    
    ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/storage-bucket-table-2x.png)
    
    If there is a recommendation available to address any of the insights for the bucket, the Google Cloud console displays the **Recommendation available** ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/recommender-yes.svg) icon.
    
    > **Note:** Recommender does not analyze permissions for all roles. To learn which roles Recommender analyzes, see [Availability of IAM policy recommendations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview#availability) .

3.  If there are recommendations to review, click a policy insight summary to open the **Security recommendations** pane. This pane lists all principals who have a role on the bucket, their roles, and any policy insights associated with those roles.
    
    ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/storage-bucket-recommendations.png)
    
    ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/storage-bucket-recommendations-2x.png)

4.  Click a **Recommendation available** ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/recommender-yes.svg) icon to get details about the recommendation.
    
    If the recommendation is to replace the role, the role recommendation always suggests a set of [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles) that you can apply.
    
    In some cases, the role recommendation also suggests creating a new [custom role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) at the project level. If a custom role recommendation is available, the Google Cloud console shows it by default. To switch to the predefined role recommendation, click **View recommended predefined role** .

5.  Review the recommendation carefully and make sure you understand when it was last refreshed and how it will change the principal's access to Google Cloud resources. Except in the case of [recommendations for service agents](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview#service-agents) , a recommendation will never increase a principal's level of access. For more information, see [How role recommendations are generated](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview#how-recommender-works) .
    
    To learn how to review recommendations in the console, see [Review recommendations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/review-apply-role-recommendations-buckets#review) on this page.

6.  Optional: If the recommendation is to create a custom role, update the **Title** , **Description** , **ID** , and **Role launch stage** as needed.
    
    If you need to add permissions to the custom role, click **Add permissions** .
    
    If you need to remove permissions from the custom role, clear the checkbox for each permission that you want to remove.

7.  Take action on the recommendation.
    
    To apply the recommendation, click **Apply** or **Create and apply** . If you change your mind in the next 90 days, use the [recommendations history](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/review-apply-role-recommendations-buckets#history) to revert your choice.
    
    To dismiss the recommendation, click **Dismiss** , then confirm your choice. You can [restore a dismissed recommendation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/review-apply-role-recommendations-buckets#history) as long as the recommendation is still valid.

8.  Repeat the previous steps until you have reviewed all of your recommendations.

### gcloud

**Review your recommendations:**

To list your bucket-level recommendations, run the [`gcloud recommender recommendations list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/recommender/recommendations/list) command, filtering for only Cloud Storage bucket recommendations:

    gcloud recommender recommendations list \
        --location=LOCATION \
        --recommender=google.iam.policy.Recommender \
        --project=PROJECT_ID \
        --format=json \
        --filter="recommenderSubtype:REMOVE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET OR recommenderSubtype:REPLACE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET"

Replace the following values:

  - `  LOCATION  ` : The region where your Cloud Storage buckets are located—for example, `us` or `us-central1` .
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : The ID of the Google Cloud project that contains your Cloud Storage buckets. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .

The response is similar to the following example. In this example, all authenticated users ( `allAuthenticatedUsers` ) have the Storage Legacy Object Reader role ( `roles/storage.legacyObjectReader` ) on the bucket `mybucket` . However, this role hasn't been used in the past 90 days. As a result, the role recommendation suggests that you revoke the role:

            "insight": "projects/123456789012/locations/us/insightTypes/google.iam.policy.Insight/insights/7849add9-73c0-419e-b169-42b3671173fb"
          }
        ],
        "associatedResourceNames": [

                  "path": "/iamPolicy/bindings/*/members/*",
                  "pathFilters": {
                    "/iamPolicy/bindings/*/condition/expression": "",
                    "/iamPolicy/bindings/*/members/*": "allAuthenticatedUsers",
                    "/iamPolicy/bindings/*/role": "roles/storage.legacyObjectReader"
                  },
                  "resource": "//storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket",
                  "resourceType": "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
        "description": "This role has not been used during the observation window.",
        "etag": "\"7caf4103d7669e12\"",
        "lastRefreshTime": "2022-05-24T07:00:00Z",
        "name": "projects/123456789012/locations/us/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/recommendations/fbc885b7-f0a8-47e6-90fe-6141aa2c4257",
        "primaryImpact": {
          "category": "SECURITY",
          "securityProjection": {
            "details": {
              "revokedIamPermissionsCount": 1
            }
          }
        },
        "priority": "P1",
        "recommenderSubtype": "REMOVE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET",
        "stateInfo": {
          "state": "ACTIVE"
        }
      }
    ]

Review each recommendation carefully and consider when it was last refreshed and how it will change the principal's access to Google Cloud resources. To learn how to review recommendations from the gcloud CLI, see [Review recommendations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/review-apply-role-recommendations-buckets#review) on this page.

**To apply a recommendation:**

1.  Use the [`gcloud recommender recommendations mark-claimed` command](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/recommender/recommendations/mark-claimed) to change the recommendation's state to `CLAIMED,` which prevents the recommendation from changing while you apply it:
    
        gcloud recommender recommendations mark-claimed \
            RECOMMENDATION_ID \
            --location=LOCATION \
            --recommender=google.iam.policy.Recommender \
            --project=PROJECT_ID \
            --format=FORMAT \
            --etag=ETAG \
            --state-metadata=STATE_METADATA
    
    Replace the following values:
    
      - `  RECOMMENDATION_ID  ` : The unique identifier for the recommendation. This value appears at the end of the `name` field in the recommendation. For example, if the `name` field is `projects/example-project/locations/global/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/recommendations/fb927dc1-9695-4436-0000-f0f285007c0f` , the recommendation ID is `fb927dc1-9695-4436-0000-f0f285007c0f` .
      - `  LOCATION  ` : The region where your Cloud Storage bucket is located—for example, `us` or `us-central1` .
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : The ID of the Google Cloud project that contains your Cloud Storage buckets. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .
      - `  FORMAT  ` : The format of the response. Use `json` or `yaml` .
      - `  ETAG  ` : The value of the `etag` field in the recommendation, such as `"dd0686e7136a4cbb"` . Note that this value can include quotes.
      - `  STATE_METADATA  ` : Optional. Comma-separated key-value pairs that contain your choice of metadata about the recommendation. For example, `--state-metadata=reviewedBy=alice,priority=high` . The metadata replaces the `stateInfo.stateMetadata` field in the recommendation.
    
    If the command succeeds, the response shows the recommendation in a `CLAIMED` state, as shown in the following example. For clarity, the example omits most fields:
    
        ...
        "priority": "P1",
        "recommenderSubtype": "REMOVE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET",
        "stateInfo": {
          "state": "CLAIMED"
        }
        ...

2.  [Get the allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#getting-policy) for the bucket, then [modify and set the allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#modifying-policy) so that it reflects the recommendation.

3.  Update the recommendation's state to `SUCCEEDED` , if you were able to apply the recommendation, or `FAILED` , if you could not apply the recommendation:
    
        gcloud recommender recommendations COMMAND \
            RECOMMENDATION_ID \
            --location=LOCATION \
            --recommender=google.iam.policy.Recommender \
            --project=PROJECT_ID \
            --format=FORMAT \
            --etag=ETAG \
            --state-metadata=STATE_METADATA
    
    Replace the following values:
    
      - `  COMMAND  ` : Use `mark-succeeded` , if you were able to apply the recommendation, or `mark-failed` , if you could not apply the recommendation.
      - `  RECOMMENDATION_ID  ` : The unique identifier for the recommendation. This value appears at the end of the `name` field in the recommendation. For example, if the `name` field is `projects/example-project/locations/global/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/recommendations/fb927dc1-9695-4436-0000-f0f285007c0f` , the recommendation ID is `fb927dc1-9695-4436-0000-f0f285007c0f` .
      - `  LOCATION  ` : The region where your Cloud Storage bucket is located—for example, `us` or `us-central1` .
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : The ID of the Google Cloud project that contains your Cloud Storage buckets. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .
      - `  FORMAT  ` : The format of the response. Use `json` or `yaml` .
      - `  ETAG  ` : The value of the `etag` field in the recommendation, such as `"dd0686e7136a4cbb"` . Note that this value can include quotes.
      - `  STATE_METADATA  ` : Optional. Comma-separated key-value pairs that contain your choice of metadata about the recommendation. For example, `--state-metadata=reviewedBy=alice,priority=high` . The metadata replaces the `stateInfo.stateMetadata` field in the recommendation.
    
    For example, if you marked the recommendation as having succeeded, the response shows the recommendation in a `SUCCEEDED` state. For clarity, this example omits most fields:
    
        ...
        "priority": "P1",
        "recommenderSubtype": "REMOVE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET",
        "stateInfo": {
          "state": "SUCCEEDED"
        }
        ...

### REST

**Review your recommendations:**

To list all available recommendations for your Cloud Storage buckets, use the Recommender API's `  recommendations.list  ` method.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : The ID of the Google Cloud project that contains your Cloud Storage buckets. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .
  - `  LOCATION  ` : The region where your Cloud Storage buckets are located—for example, `us` or `us-central1` .
  - `  PAGE_SIZE  ` : Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request. If not specified, the server will determine the number of results to return. If the number of recommendations is greater than the page size, the response contains a pagination token that you can use to retrieve the next page of results.
  - `  PAGE_TOKEN  ` : Optional. The pagination token returned in an earlier response from this method. If specified, the list of recommendations will start where the previous request ended.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .

HTTP method and URL:

    GET https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/recommendations?filter=recommenderSubtype%20%3D%20REMOVE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET%20OR%20recommenderSubtype%20%3D%20REPLACE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET&pageSize=PAGE_SIZE&pageToken=PAGE_TOKEN

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    curl -X GET \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         -H "x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID" \
         "https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/recommendations?filter=recommenderSubtype%20%3D%20REMOVE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET%20OR%20recommenderSubtype%20%3D%20REPLACE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET&pageSize=PAGE_SIZE&pageToken=PAGE_TOKEN"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = "PROJECT_ID" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method GET `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Uri "https://recommender.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/recommenders/google.iam.policy.Recommender/recommendations?filter=recommenderSubtype%20%3D%20REMOVE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET%20OR%20recommenderSubtype%20%3D%20REPLACE_ROLE_STORAGE_BUCKET&pageSize=PAGE_SIZE&pageToken=PAGE_TOKEN" | Select-Object -Expand Content

The response is similar to the following example. In this example, all authenticated users ( `allAuthenticatedUsers` ) have the Storage Legacy Object Reader role ( `roles/storage.legacyObjectReader` ) on the bucket `mybucket` . However, this role hasn't been used in the past 90 days. As a result, the role recommendation suggests that you revoke the role:

          }
        ],
        "priority": "P1"
      ]
    }

Review each recommendation carefully and consider when it was last refreshed and how it will change the principal's access to Google Cloud resources. To learn how to review recommendations from the REST API, see [Review recommendations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/review-apply-role-recommendations-buckets#review) on this page.

**To apply a recommendation:**

1.  Mark the recommendation as `CLAIMED` :
    
    To mark a recommendation as `CLAIMED` , which prevents the recommendation from changing while you apply it, use the Recommender API's `  recommendations.markClaimed  ` method.
    
    Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:
    
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : The ID of the Google Cloud project that contains your Cloud Storage buckets. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .
      - `  LOCATION  ` : The region where your Cloud Storage bucket is located—for example, `us` or `us-central1` .
      - `  RECOMMENDATION_ID  ` : The unique identifier for the recommendation. This value appears at the end of the `name` field in the recommendation.

## Understand recommendations

Each recommendation includes information to help you understand why the recommendation was made.

### Console

To help you understand why the recommendation was made, the Google Cloud console shows the principal's permission usage, as reported by the [policy insight](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview#how-policy-insights-work) associated with the recommendation.

> **Note** : If a recommendation is for a [basic role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#basic) , the list of permissions in the Google Cloud console might not include all of the permissions that a principal needs. This is because some services use basic roles to indirectly grant additional roles. The list of permissions might not include permissions from these additional roles, even if a principal used them. Role recommendations automatically account for this discrepancy.
> 
> Indirectly granted roles include roles granted through [Cloud Storage convenience values](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam#convenience-values) and [BigQuery special group membership](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control-basic-roles) .

To help you understand the impact of applying the recommendation, the Google Cloud console also shows a color- and symbol-coded list of permissions. This list indicates how the principal's permissions will change if you apply the recommendation. For example, it might show a list like the following:

![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/storage-bucket-single-recommendation.png)

![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/storage-bucket-single-recommendation.png)

The types of permissions associated with each color and symbol are as follows:

  - **Gray with no symbol** : Permissions that are in both the principal's current role and the recommended roles.
    
    ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/recommender-permission-gray.png)

  - **Red with a minus sign (-)** : Permissions that are in the principal's current role, but not in the recommended roles because the principal hasn't used them in the past 90 days.
    
    ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/recommender-permission-red.png)

  - **Green with a plus sign (+)** : Permissions that are not in the principal's current role, but are in the recommended roles. This type of permission appears only in [recommendations for service agents](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview#service-agents) .
    
    ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/recommender-permission-green.png)

  - **Blue with a *Machine learning* icon ( ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/recommender-ml.svg) )** : Permissions that are in both the principal's current role and the recommended roles, not because the principal has used the permissions in the past 90 days, but because Recommender has determined through [machine learning](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview#ml) that they are likely to need those permissions in the future.

### gcloud

Each recommendation includes information to help you understand why the recommendation was made.

For details on the fields of a recommendation, see the [`Recommendation` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/recommender/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.recommenders.recommendations#resource-recommendation) .

To see the permission usage that this recommendation is based on, view the [policy insights](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview#how-policy-insights-work) that are associated with the recommendation. These insights are listed in the `associatedInsights` field. To view a policy insight that is associated with the recommendation, do the following:

1.  Copy the associated insight's ID. The ID is everything after `insights/` in the `insight` field. For example, if the `insight` field reads `projects/123456789012/locations/us/insightTypes/google.iam.policy.Insight/insights/7849add9-73c0-419e-b169-42b3671173fb` , the insight ID is `7849add9-73c0-419e-b169-42b3671173fb` .
2.  Follow the instructions to [get a policy insight](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/policy-insights-buckets#get-insight) , using the insight ID you copied.

## View, revert, and restore changes

After you apply or dismiss a recommendation for a project-level role binding, that action appears in the recommendations history.

You can view the recommendations history for a bucket in the Google Cloud console:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Buckets** page.

2.  Find the **Security insights** column. If the column is not visible, click **Column display options** view\_column and select **Security insights** .

3.  Find the bucket whose recommendation history you want to view, then click the security insight summary in that row.

4.  In the **Security recommendations** pane that appears, click the **Recommendations history** tab.
    
    The Google Cloud console shows a list of previous actions on your role recommendations.

5.  To view details about a recommendation, click the expand\_more expander arrow.
    
    The Google Cloud console shows details about the action that was taken, including the principal that took the action:

    ![](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/policy-intelligence/img/storage-bucket-recommendation-history.png)

6.  Optional: If necessary, you can revert the recommendation, which undoes the changes in the recommendation, or restore a recommendation that you dismissed.
    
    To revert a previously applied change for a recommendation, click **Revert** . The Google Cloud console reverts the changes to the principal's roles. The recommendation no longer appears in the Google Cloud console.
    
    To restore a recommendation that was dismissed, click **Restore** . The recommendation becomes visible on the **IAM** page in the Google Cloud console. No roles or permissions are changed.
