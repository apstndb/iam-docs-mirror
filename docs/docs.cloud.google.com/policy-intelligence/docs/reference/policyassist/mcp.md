A [Model Context Protocol (MCP) server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts) acts as a proxy between an external service that provides context, data, or capabilities to a Large Language Model (LLM) or AI application. MCP servers connect AI applications to external systems such as databases and web services, translating their responses into a format that the AI application can understand.

### Server Setup

You must [enable MCP servers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/enable-disable-mcp-servers) and [set up authentication](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/authenticate-mcp) before use. For more information about using Google and Google Cloud remote MCP servers, see [Google Cloud MCP servers overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/overview) .

### Server Endpoints

An MCP service endpoint is the network address and communication interface (usually a URL) of the MCP server that an AI application (the Host for the MCP client) uses to establish a secure, standardized connection. It is the point of contact for the LLM to request context, call a tool, or access a resource. Google MCP endpoints can be global or regional.

The Policy Assist API MCP server has the following global MCP endpoint:

  - https://policyassist.googleapis.com/mcp

## MCP Tools

An [MCP tool](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/concepts/tools) is a function or executable capability that an MCP server exposes to a LLM or AI application to perform an action in the real world.

### Tools

The policyassist.googleapis.com MCP server has the following tool:

MCP Tools

`  recommend_iam_roles  `

This tool returns IAM role suggestions based on the intent of a user's prompt. Example prompt: 'What role do I need to read Google Cloud Storage buckets?'

### Get MCP tool specifications

To get the MCP tool specifications for all tools in an MCP server, use the `tools/list` method. The following example demonstrates how to use `curl` to list all tools and their specifications currently available within the MCP server.
