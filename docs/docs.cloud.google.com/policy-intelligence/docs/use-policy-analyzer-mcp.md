data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

This document shows you how to use the Policy Analyzer remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to connect with AI applications including Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, Claude, and custom applications you are developing. The Policy Analyzer remote MCP server provides your agents direct access to tools that can help analyze and audit Identity and Access Management configurations. The Policy Analyzer remote MCP server is enabled when you enable the Policy Analyzer API.

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) standardizes how large language models (LLMs) and AI applications or agents connect to external data sources. MCP servers let you use their tools, resources, and prompts to take actions and get updated data from their backend service.

## What's the difference between local and remote MCP servers?

  - Local MCP servers  
    Typically run on your local machine and use the standard input and output streams (stdio) for communication between services on the same device.
  - Remote MCP servers  
    Run on the service's infrastructure and offer an HTTP endpoint to AI applications for communication between the AI MCP client and the MCP server. For more information about MCP architecture, see [MCP architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture) .

## Google and Google Cloud remote MCP servers

Google and Google Cloud remote MCP servers have the following features and benefits:

  - Simplified, centralized discovery
  - Managed global or regional HTTP endpoints
  - Fine-grained authorization
  - Optional prompt and response security with Model Armor protection
  - Centralized audit logging

For information about other MCP servers and information about security and governance controls available for Google Cloud MCP servers, see [Google Cloud MCP servers overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/overview) .

## Before you begin

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to use the Policy Analyzer MCP server, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project where you want to use the Policy Analyzer MCP server:

  - [Cloud Asset Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudasset#cloudasset.viewer) ( `roles/cloudasset.viewer` )
  - To analyze policies with [custom IAM roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) : [Role Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.roleViewer) ( `roles/iam.roleViewer` )
  - To use the Google Cloud CLI to analyze policies: [Service Usage Consumer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/serviceusage#serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer) ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` )
  - Make MCP tool calls: [MCP Tool User](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/mcp#mcp.toolUser) ( `roles/mcp.toolUser` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to use the Policy Analyzer MCP server. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to use the Policy Analyzer MCP server:

  - `cloudasset.assets.analyzeIamPolicy`
  - `cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources`
  - `cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies`
  - To analyze policies with custom IAM roles: `iam.roles.get`
  - To use the Google Cloud CLI to analyze policies: `serviceusage.services.use`
  - Make MCP tool calls: `mcp.tools.call`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Authentication and authorization

The Policy Analyzer remote MCP server uses the [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) protocol with [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) for authentication and authorization. All [Google Cloud identities](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/identity-products) are supported for authentication to MCP servers.

The Policy Analyzer remote MCP server does not accept API keys.

We recommend that you create a separate identity for agents that are using MCP tools so that access to resources can be controlled and monitored. For more information about authentication, see [Authenticate to MCP servers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/authenticate-mcp) .

## Policy Analyzer MCP OAuth scopes

OAuth 2.0 uses scopes and credentials to determine if an authenticated principal is authorized to take a specific action on a resource. For more information about OAuth 2.0 scopes at Google, read [Using OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) .

Policy Analyzer has the following MCP tool OAuth scopes:

| Scope URI for gcloud CLI                     | Description                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudasset` | See, edit, configure, and delete your Cloud Asset Inventory data and see the email address for your Google Account. |

Additional scopes might be required on the resources accessed during a tool call. To view a list of scopes required for Policy Analyzer, see the [OAuth scopes for the Policy Analyzer API](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#policyanalyzer) .

## Configure an MCP client to use the Policy Analyzer MCP server

AI applications and agents, such as Claude or Antigravity, can instantiate an MCP client that connects to a single MCP server. An AI application can have multiple clients that connect to different MCP servers. If your application isn't listed in the [client-specific guidance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application#client-specific-guidance) , then you can use the following information to connect from most applications.

In your AI application, look for a way to add or connect to a remote MCP server. For the Policy Analyzer MCP server, enter the following information as required:

  - **Server name** : Policy Analyzer MCP server
  - **Server URL** or **Endpoint** : `https://cloudasset.googleapis.com/mcp`
  - **Transport** : HTTP
  - **Authentication details** : Depending on how you want to authenticate, you can enter your Google Cloud credentials, your OAuth Client ID and secret, or an agent identity and credentials. For more information about authentication, see [Authenticate to MCP servers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/authenticate-mcp) .
  - **OAuth scope** : To access the Policy Analyzer MCP server, use the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudasset` [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes)

For application-specific guidance about setting up and connecting to MCP server, see [Client-specific guidance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application#client-specific-guidance) .

For more general guidance, see the following resources:

  - [Connect to remote MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-remote-servers) .
  - [Configure MCP in an AI application](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/configure-mcp-ai-application) .

### Redirect URIs

For web-based applications, and some desktop applications, you must allowlist a redirect URI when you create a client ID and secret for authentication. Redirect URIs are used by the authorization server to send tokens to your application. Your application's documentation should specify the redirect URI that you must use. [Custom redirect URIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app#redirect-uri_custom-scheme) aren't supported.

## Available tools

To view details of available MCP tools and their descriptions for the Policy Analyzer MCP server, see the [Policy Analyzer MCP reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/reference/mcp) .

### List tools

Use the [MCP inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to list tools, or send a `tools/list` HTTP request directly to the Policy Analyzer remote MCP server. The `tools/list` method doesn't require authentication.

    POST /mcp HTTP/1.1
    Host: cloudasset.googleapis.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "tools/list"
    }

## Example use cases

The Policy Analyzer MCP server lets your agent analyze and audit IAM access paths. The following are example use cases for the Policy Analyzer MCP server:

| Use case                                                                                           | Prompt examples                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analyzing IAM allow policies within a given scope to answer questions about who can access what.   | "Generate a full report of all identities that can delete BigQuery datasets anywhere in the `data-analytics-prod` project."                                 |
| Exporting the results of a policy analysis to a specified BigQuery dataset or Cloud Storage bucket | "Export this analysis to the `audit-project:iam_analysis.bq_deleters` BigQuery table. Make sure to expand group memberships where I have view permissions." |

## Optional security and safety configurations

MCP introduces new security risks and considerations due to the wide variety of actions that you can do with the MCP tools. To minimize and manage these risks, Google Cloud offers default settings and customizable policies to control the use of MCP tools in your Google Cloud organization or project.

For more information about MCP security and governance, see [AI security and safety](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/ai-security-safety) .

### Use Model Armor

[Model Armor](https://docs.cloud.google.com/model-armor/overview) is a Google Cloud service designed to enhance the security and safety of your AI applications. It works by proactively screening LLM prompts and responses, protecting against various risks and supporting responsible AI practices. Whether you are deploying AI in your cloud environment, or on external cloud providers, Model Armor can help you prevent malicious input, verify content safety, protect sensitive data, maintain compliance, and enforce your AI safety and security policies consistently across your diverse AI landscape.

When Model Armor is enabled with [logging enabled](https://docs.cloud.google.com/model-armor/configure-logging) , Model Armor logs the entire payload. This might expose sensitive information in your logs.

#### MCP request routing to Model Armor

The Policy Intelligence MCP server uses [cross-jurisdictional routing](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/model-armor-supported-products#cross-jurisdictional-routing) . When you enable Model Armor, the MCP server sends all requests to Model Armor for screening. Cross-jurisdictional routing might break existing data residency compliance commitments for in-use and in-transit data. For more information about the behavior of other MCP servers, see [Model Armor supported products](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/model-armor-supported-products) .

#### Enable Model Armor

You must enable Model Armor APIs before you can use Model Armor.

### Console

1.  Enable the Model Armor API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role ( `roles/owner` ). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

2.  Select the project where you want to activate Model Armor.

### gcloud

Before you begin, follow these steps using the Google Cloud CLI with the Model Armor API:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.

2.  Run the following command to set the API endpoint for the Model Armor service.
    
        gcloud config set api_endpoint_overrides/modelarmor "https://modelarmor.LOCATION.rep.googleapis.com/"
    
    Replace `  LOCATION  ` with the region where you want to use Model Armor.

#### Configure protection for Google and Google Cloud remote MCP servers

To help protect your MCP tool calls and responses you can use Model Armor floor settings. A floor setting defines the minimum security filters that apply across the project. This configuration applies a consistent set of filters to all MCP tool calls and responses within the project.

> **Tip:** Don't enable the prompt injection and jailbreak filter unless your MCP traffic carries natural language data.

Set up a Model Armor floor setting with MCP sanitization enabled. For more information, see [Configure Model Armor floor settings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/model-armor/configure-floor-settings) .

> **Note:** If the agent and the MCP server are in different projects, you can create floor settings in both projects (the client project and the resource project). In this case, Model Armor is invoked twice, once for each project.

See the following example command:

    gcloud model-armor floorsettings update \
    --full-uri='projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/floorSetting' \
    --enable-floor-setting-enforcement=TRUE \
    --add-integrated-services=GOOGLE_MCP_SERVER \
    --google-mcp-server-enforcement-type=INSPECT_AND_BLOCK \
    --enable-google-mcp-server-cloud-logging \
    --malicious-uri-filter-settings-enforcement=ENABLED \
    --add-rai-settings-filters='[{"confidenceLevel": "MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE", "filterType": "DANGEROUS"}]'

Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your Google Cloud project ID.

Note the following settings:

  - `INSPECT_AND_BLOCK` : The enforcement type that inspects content for the Google MCP server and blocks prompts and responses that match the filters.
  - `ENABLED` : The setting that enables a filter or enforcement.
  - `MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` : The confidence level for the Responsible AI - Dangerous filter settings. You can modify this setting, though lower values might result in more false positives. For more information, see [Model Armor confidence levels](https://docs.cloud.google.com/model-armor/overview#ma-confidence-levels) .

#### Disable scanning MCP traffic with Model Armor

To stop Model Armor from automatically scanning traffic to and from Google MCP servers based on the project's floor settings, run the following command:

    gcloud model-armor floorsettings update \
      --full-uri='projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/floorSetting' \
      --remove-integrated-services=GOOGLE_MCP_SERVER

Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with the Google Cloud project ID. Model Armor doesn't automatically apply the rules defined in this project's floor settings to any Google MCP server traffic.

Model Armor floor settings and general configuration can impact more than just MCP. Because Model Armor integrates with services like Vertex AI, any changes you make to floor settings can affect traffic scanning and safety behaviors across all integrated services, not just MCP.

### Control MCP use with Identity and Access Management deny policies

Identity and Access Management (IAM) [deny policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-overview) and [allow policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies) help you secure Google Cloud and Google MCP servers.

You can combine multiple criteria to build customized security and governance policies by allowing or denying access based on the following:

  - The principal.
  - Tool properties like the read-only attribute.
  - The service name or tool name.
  - The application's OAuth client ID.

For more information, see [Control MCP use with Identity and Access Management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/mcp/control-mcp-use-iam) .
