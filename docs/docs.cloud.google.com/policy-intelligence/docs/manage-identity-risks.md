Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

As an IAM administrator, you can review and manage identity risks across your organization, folder, or project from the Google Cloud console by using the **Security Insights** dashboard.

The **Security Insights** dashboard lets you do the following:

  - Review risks associated with vulnerable human, non-human, and group identities.

  - View the type and severity of identity risks associated with an organization, folder, or project.

  - Prioritize and remediate risks with actionable insights for both Google Cloud and other third-party identity providers.

> **Important:** To review insights and recommendations for all roles on your resource, you must [activate Security Command Center Enterprise or Premium tier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/activate-scc-overview) on your resource. Otherwise, you can only review insights and recommendations for `Owner` , `Editor` , and `Viewer` roles. For more information, see [Billing questions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/billing-questions) .

## Before you begin

To get the permissions that you need to review and manage identity risks, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the organization, folder, or project that you want to review and manage identity risks for:

  - Review identity risks: [IAM Recommender Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/recommender#recommender.iamViewer) ( `roles/recommender.iamViewer` )
  - Apply or dismiss recommendations: [IAM Recommender Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/recommender#recommender.iamAdmin) ( `roles/recommender.iamAdmin` )

> **Note:** [IAM basic roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#basic) might also contain permissions to review and manage identity risks. You shouldn't grant basic roles in a production environment, but you can grant them in a development or test environment.

## Review identity risks

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM & Admin \> Security Insights** page.

2.  Select the organization, folder, or project that you want to review the identity risks for.
    
    The **Security Insights** dashboard displays the following widgets for the selected resource:
    
      - **Identity risk overview** : Shows the total number of identities with role bindings, the total number of risky human, non-human, and group identities, and their severity levels.
        
        The total number of identities is the sum of unique identities in the allow policies that are attached to the selected resource. This number doesn't include the identities from the allow policies that are attached to the child resources of the selected resource. For example, if your selected resource is an organization, then the identities from the allow policies that are attached to its individual folders or projects are not included.
        
        > **Note:** If an identity has both a high-risk and low-risk recommendation, it's classified as a high-risk identity.
    
      - **Risks by finding category** : Lists risky identities based on category such as `Unused IAM role` or `IAM role has excessive permissions` .
        
        The total number of findings in the **Risks by finding category** widget might differ from the number of insights in other widgets. This difference occurs because multiple insights of the same severity for the same resource are grouped into a single finding in other widgets.
        
        > **Note:** The details of findings are shown on the [**Findings page**](https://docs.cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/ciem-identity-access-findings) in Security Command Center. To review findings for a category, click the number of findings in the same row. To review all identity and access findings, click **View all findings** .
    
      - **Top risky groups** : Shows groups with the highest excessive permissions.
    
      - **Top risky human identities** : Shows human identities with the highest excessive permissions.
    
      - **Top risky non-human identities** : Shows non-human identities with the highest excessive permissions.
    
      - **Active IAM recommendations trend** : Shows active role recommendations for a specified time period.

## Manage identity risks

You can view insights and recommendations to manage the risks that are associated with an identity.

To manage identity risks, do the following from any widget on the dashboard:

1.  For a risky identity, click the number of insights in the **Insights** column.

2.  In the **Insights** pane, to filter insights by type, select the required type from the list.

3.  Depending on whether a recommendation is available for an insight, you can either view its details or view its recommendation.
    
      - For an insight without a recommendation, click **View details** .
        
        The **Permissions** pane provides details on the insight.
    
      - For an insight with a recommendation, click **View recommendation** .
        
        The **Recommendation** pane provides details about the suggested role removal or replacement.
        
        Only for group principals with excessive permissions, you have an option to replace permanent access with temporary, on-demand access ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ) using Privileged Access Manager. If members of a group don't need permanent access to a role's permissions, but might need them for unanticipated reasons in the future, you can remove their permanent access and use Privileged Access Manager to allow them to request temporary access when they need it. To learn how to remediate excessive permissions with Privileged Access Manager, see [Remediate excessive permissions with Privileged Access Manager](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-remediate-iam-recommendations) .

4.  To apply or dismiss the recommendation, click **Apply** or **Dismiss** .
    
    It takes time for access changes to propagate through the system. To learn how long it takes, on average, for access changes to propagate, see [Access change propagation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-change-propagation) .
    
    > **Note:** It might take up to 24 hours for the changes to appear on the **Findings** page in Security Command Center.
