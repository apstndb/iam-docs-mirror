Update details_rules.

At most one of these can be specified:

`--details-rules` =\[ `conditions` = `CONDITIONS` \],\[ `description` = `DESCRIPTION` \],\[ `effect` = `EFFECT` \],\[ `excludedPrincipals` = `EXCLUDEDPRINCIPALS` \],\[ `operation` = `OPERATION` \],\[ `principals` = `PRINCIPALS` \]

Set details_rules to new value. A list of access policy rules.

`conditions`  
The conditions that determine whether this rule applies to a request. Conditions are identified by their key, which is the FQDN of the service that they are relevant to. For example: `"conditions": { "iam.googleapis.com": { "expression": <cel expression> } }` . Each rule is evaluated independently. If this rule does not apply to a request, other rules might still apply. Currently supported keys are as follows:

- `eventarc.googleapis.com` : Can use `CEL` functions that evaluate resource fields.

- `iam.googleapis.com` : Can use `CEL` functions that evaluate [resource tags](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-tags) and combine them using boolean and logical operators. Other functions and operators are not supported.

`KEY`  
Sets `KEY` value.

`VALUE`  
Sets `VALUE` value.

`description`  
Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.

`expression`  
Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.

`location`  
String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.

`title`  
Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.

`description`  
Customer specified description of the rule. Must be less than or equal to 256 characters.

`effect`  
The effect of the rule.

`excludedPrincipals`  
The identities that are excluded from the access policy rule, even if they are listed in the `principals` . For example, you could add a Google group to the `principals` , then exclude specific users who belong to that group.

`operation`  
Attributes that are used to determine whether this rule applies to a request.

`excludedPermissions`  
Specifies the permissions that this rule excludes from the set of affected permissions given by `permissions` . If a permission appears in `permissions` `and` in `excluded_permissions` then it will `not` be subject to the policy effect.

The excluded permissions can be specified using the same syntax as `permissions` .

`permissions`  
The permissions that are explicitly affected by this rule. Each permission uses the format `{service_fqdn}/{resource}.{verb}` , where `{service_fqdn}` is the fully qualified domain name for the service. Currently supported permissions are as follows:

- `eventarc.googleapis.com/messageBuses.publish` .

`principals`  
The identities for which this rule's effect governs using one or more permissions on Google Cloud resources. This field can contain the following values:

- `principal://goog/subject/{email_id}` : A specific Google Account. Includes Gmail, Cloud Identity, and Google Workspace user accounts. For example, `principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com` .

If an identifier that was previously set on a policy is soft deleted, then calls to read that policy will return the identifier with a deleted prefix. Users cannot set identifiers with this syntax.

- `deleted:principal://goog/subject/{email_id}?uid={uid}` : A specific Google Account that was deleted recently. For example, `deleted:principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com?uid=1234567890` . If the Google Account is recovered, this identifier reverts to the standard identifier for a Google Account.

- `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}?uid={uid}` : A Google group that was deleted recently. For example, `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com?uid=1234567890` . If the Google group is restored, this identifier reverts to the standard identifier for a Google group.

- `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}?uid={uid}` : A Google Cloud service account that was deleted recently. For example, `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@iam.gserviceaccount.com?uid=1234567890` . If the service account is undeleted, this identifier reverts to the standard identifier for a service account.

`Shorthand Example:`

```
