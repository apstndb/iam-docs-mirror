## June 30, 2022

Fixed

In June 2022, IAM had an issue that resulted in excess [usage metrics for service accounts and service account keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-monitoring) when any of the following actions were performed:

  - [Listing service account keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#list-keys)
  - [Getting a service account key](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#get-key)
  - [Disabling a service account key](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#disabling)
  - [Enabling a service account key](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#enabling)

Each time you took any of these actions, Cloud Monitoring recorded an authentication usage metric for the parent service account, and for each of its service account keys, regardless of whether you used the service account or its keys to authenticate. These excess metrics were visible in [Cloud Monitoring](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-monitoring#view-metrics-all) , and in the [metrics for individual service accounts and keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-monitoring#view-metrics-single-sa) , from June 7, 2022, through June 17, 2022.

In addition, these excess metrics were visible in other systems that use data from Cloud Monitoring, including [Activity Analyzer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/activity-analyzer-service-account-authentication) , which shows when service accounts and keys were used to authenticate, and [service account insights](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/service-account-insights) , which provide findings about unused service accounts. Excess metrics were visible in these systems from June 7, 2022, through June 22, 2022.

This issue has been corrected, and Cloud Monitoring is no longer recording these excess metrics. However, the [last authentication time](https://docs.cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/activity-analyzer-service-account-authentication#view-recent-multiple-accounts-or-keys) for each service account and key will continue to reflect the excess metrics indefinitely, until you authenticate with the service account or key again.

Issue

If you run one of the `gcloud` tool's `add-iam-policy-binding` commands, and the IAM policy contains conditional role bindings for that role, the `gcloud` tool prompts you to choose one of the condition expressions that exists in the policy. If you choose a condition expression that contains a comma, the command fails.

To work around this issue, use the `--condition` flag to specify a condition expression on the command line.

## January 20, 2021

  - You can now manage permissions for Cloud Storage objects, in addition to buckets.
  - You can now use IAM Conditions to control which permissions are available in a short-lived OAuth 2.0 access token. For an example, see [Limit permissions for specific objects](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/downscoping-short-lived-credentials#example-object-startswith) .
  - You can now use Credential Access Boundaries with a Cloud Storage bucket that does not use [uniform bucket-level access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access) .

Change

For [Credential Access Boundaries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/downscoping-short-lived-credentials) , currently in beta, you must migrate to a new API endpoint, `sts.googleapis.com` . To learn how to use the new API endpoint, see [Exchanging the OAuth 2.0 access token](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/downscoping-short-lived-credentials#exchange-credential) .

Change

We are delaying the upcoming changes for [deleted members that are bound to a role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/release-notes#July_01_2020) . These changes will take effect starting on September 14, 2020.

Change

The documentation now describes [best practices for using the IAM recommender](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/recommender-best-practices) .

## July 20, 2020

Change

We are delaying the upcoming changes for [deleted members that are bound to a role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/release-notes#July_01_2020) . These changes will take effect starting on August 31, 2020.

## July 01, 2020

Change

The organization policy constraint to [prevent automatic role grants to IAM service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-service-accounts#disable_service_account_default_grants) is now [generally available](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) . To improve security, we strongly recommend that you enable this constraint.

Issue

Starting on July 27, 2020, if a binding in a policy refers to a deleted member (for example, `deleted:user:tamika@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901` ), you cannot add a binding for a newly created member with the same name (in this case, `user:tamika@example.com` ). If you try to add a binding for the newly created member, IAM will apply the binding to the deleted member instead.

To resolve this issue, see our guidance on [updating policies that contain deleted members](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies#handle-deleted-members) .

Change

Starting on July 27, 2020, IAM policies will identify deleted members that are bound to a role. Deleted members have the prefix `deleted:` and the suffix ` ?uid= numeric-id  ` .

For example, if you delete the account for the user `tamika@example.com` , and a policy binds that user to a role, the policy shows an identifier similar to `deleted:user:tamika@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901` .

For `SetIamPolicy` requests, you can use this new syntax starting on July 27. For `GetIamPolicy` and `SetIamPolicy` responses, you might see the new prefix and suffix in some, but not all, responses until we finish rolling out the change. We expect to complete the rollout by July 31, 2020.

See the documentation for a [detailed example](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies#example-deleted-member) , as well as guidance on [updating policies that contain deleted members](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies#handle-deleted-members) .

## June 22, 2020

Deprecated

Using the IAM API to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or binary blobs is now deprecated.

  - If you use the IAM API or its client libraries to sign JWTs or binary blobs, you must [migrate to the Service Account Credentials API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/migrating-to-credentials-api) before July 1, 2021.
  - If you use the `gcloud` command-line tool to sign JWTs, you must [prepare for changes to the `gcloud` tool](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/migrating-to-credentials-api#gcloud) before July 1, 2021.

## December 09, 2019

Change

IAM policies now identify deleted members that are bound to a role. Deleted members have the prefix `deleted:` and the suffix ` ?uid= [NUMERIC_ID]  ` .

For example, if you delete the account for the user `bob@example.com` , and a policy binds that user to a role, the policy shows an identifier similar to `deleted:user:bob@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901` .

For `SetIamPolicy` requests, you can use this new syntax starting today. For `GetIamPolicy` and `SetIamPolicy` responses, because we are still rolling out this change, you might see the new prefix and suffix in some, but not all, responses. We expect to complete the rollout by December 13, 2019.

Issue

If a binding in a policy refers to a deleted member (for example, `deleted:user:bob@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901` ), you cannot add a binding for a newly created member with the same name (in this case, `user:bob@example.com` ). If you try to add a binding for the newly created member, IAM will apply the binding to the deleted member instead.
