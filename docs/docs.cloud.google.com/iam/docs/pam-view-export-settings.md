> This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](https://docs.cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

As a Privileged Access Manager settings viewer, you can view the Privileged Access Manager settings for an organization, folder, or project. You can also export settings programmatically using the Google Cloud CLI.

## Before you begin

To get the permissions that you need to view Privileged Access Manager settings, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the organization, folder, or project:

  - To view settings: [PAM Settings Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/privilegedaccessmanager#privilegedaccessmanager.settingsViewer) ( `roles/privilegedaccessmanager.settingsViewer` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to view Privileged Access Manager settings. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to view Privileged Access Manager settings:

  - To view settings:
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.settings.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.settings.fetchEffective`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## View settings

### Console

1.  Go to the **Privileged Access Manager** page.

2.  Select the organization, folder, or project that you want to view Privileged Access Manager settings for.

3.  Click the **Settings** tab.

The **Settings** page displays the Privileged Access Manager settings details for the selected resource.

### gcloud

You can view the following settings for a resource:

  - [Individual settings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-view-export-settings#individual-settings) that are directly set on the resource.

  - [Effective settings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-view-export-settings#effective-settings) that are set on the resource or inherited from its parent resource.
    
    #### View individual settings for a resource

## Export settings programmatically using the gcloud CLI

The `gcloud alpha pam settings export` command retrieves and exports the settings for a specific resource.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  FILENAME  ` : The filename to export the settings contents to.
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the corresponding resource belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud alpha pam settings export \
        --destination=FILENAME.yaml \
        --location=global \
        -- RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud alpha pam settings export `
        --destination=FILENAME.yaml `
        --location=global `
        -- RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud alpha pam settings export ^
        --destination=FILENAME.yaml ^
        --location=global ^
        -- RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

You should receive a response similar to the following:

    Exported [RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID/locations/global/settings] to FILENAME.yaml.
