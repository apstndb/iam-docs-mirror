In Agent Identity auth manager, you manage auth providers by editing their details, enabling or disabling them, or deleting them when they are no longer needed.

## Before you begin

1.  [Verify that you have chosen the correct authentication method](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/agent-identity-overview#auth-models) .
2.  [Verify that you have the roles required to complete this task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-auth-providers#req-roles) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to manage Agent Identity auth providers, ask your administrator to grant you the [IAM Connector Editor](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iamconnectors#iamconnectors.editor) ( `roles/iamconnectors.editor` ) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to manage Agent Identity auth providers. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to manage Agent Identity auth providers:

  - `iamconnectors.connectors.update`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .
