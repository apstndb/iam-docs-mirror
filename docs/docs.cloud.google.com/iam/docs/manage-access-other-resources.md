This page describes the general process for granting, changing, and revoking access to resources that accept allow policies.

> **Note:** The process for managing access to certain resources might vary slightly from the process described on this page. For resource-specific instructions, see the following guides:
> 
>   - [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access)
>   - [Manage access to service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts)

In Identity and Access Management (IAM), access is granted through *allow policies* , also known as IAM policies. An allow policy is attached to a Google Cloud resource. Each allow policy contains a collection of *role bindings* that associate one or more principals, such as users or service accounts, with an IAM role. These role bindings grant the specified roles to the principals, both on the resource that the allow policy is attached to and on all of that resource's [descendants](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy) . For more information about allow policies, see [Understanding allow policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies) .

> **Note:** The IAM role picker uses Gemini to help you find and grant the right predefined roles to your principals. For more information, see [Get predefined role suggestions with Gemini assistance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/role-picker-gemini) .

This page describes how to manage access to resources using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, and the REST API. You can also manage access using the Google Cloud client libraries.

> **Note:** You can also use deny policies to prevent principals from using specific IAM permissions. For more information, see [Deny policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-overview) .

## Before you begin

  - Review the list of [resource types that accept allow policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/resource-types-with-policies) .
  - Ensure that you have the [required IAM roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#required-permissions) .

### Required roles

To manage access to a resource, you need permissions to get the resource, and to get and set the allow policy for the resource. These permissions have the following form, where `  SERVICE  ` is the name of the service that owns the resource and `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` is the name of the resource type that you want to manage access to:

  - `  SERVICE . RESOURCE_TYPE .get `
  - `  SERVICE . RESOURCE_TYPE .getIamPolicy `
  - `  SERVICE . RESOURCE_TYPE .setIamPolicy `

For example, to manage access to a Compute Engine instance, you need the following permissions:

  - `compute.instances.get`
  - `compute.instances.getIamPolicy`
  - `compute.instances.setIamPolicy`

To gain the required permissions, ask your administrator to grant you a predefined or custom role that includes the permissions. For example, your administrator could grant you the Security Admin role ( `roles/iam.securityAdmin` ), which includes permissions to manage access to almost all Google Cloud resources.

> **Note:** When you create some resources, such as projects, roles might be automatically granted on the resources. These roles are granted even if you do not have permission to manage the allow policy for the new resource. For more information, see [Default policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies#default) .

## View current access

The following section shows you how to use the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI, and the REST API to view who has access to a resource. You can also view access by using the Google Cloud client libraries to get the resource's allow policy.

> **Note:** If you grant access to a user's email alias or a secondary domain, then the values in your allow policy might not match the values that you initially entered. If you grant access to an email alias, then the allow policy displays the user's primary email address. If you grant access to a secondary domain, then the allow policy displays the primary domain.

### Console

> **Note:** The Google Cloud console shows access in a list form, rather than directly showing the resource's allow policy.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the page that lists the resource that you want to view access to.
    
    For example, to manage access to a Compute Engine instance, go to the **VM instances** page.

2.  Select the checkbox next to the resource that you want to view access to.

3.  Ensure that the info panel is visible. If it is not visible, click **Show info panel** . The info panel's **permissions** tab lists all principals who have access to the resource.
    
    If the **Show inherited permissions** switch is on, the list includes principals with inherited roles; that is, principals whose access comes from roles on parent resources rather than roles on the resource itself. For more information about policy inheritance, see [Policy inheritance and the resource hierarchy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies#inheritance) .

### gcloud

To see who has access to your resource, get the allow policy for the resource. To learn how to interpret allow policies, see [Understanding allow policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies) .

> **Note:** A resource's allow policy does not show any roles gained through [policy inheritance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies#inheritance) . To view inherited roles, use the Google Cloud console, or follow the instructions on [Viewing effective IAM policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/view-effective-iam-policies) .

To get the allow policy for the resource, run the `get-iam-policy` command for the resource.

The format for this command varies depending on the resource type you're managing access to. To find the format for your resource, find the reference for the resource's `get-iam-policy` command in the [Google Cloud CLI reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference) . This reference is organized by service, then resource. For example, to get the allow policy of a Compute Engine VM instance, follow the format described in the [`gcloud compute instances get-iam-policy` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/get-iam-policy) .

Optionally, add the following arguments to the command to specify the format and export the results:

    --format=FORMAT > PATH

Provide the following values:

  - `  FORMAT  ` : The desired format for the policy. Use `json` or `yaml` .
  - `  PATH  ` : The path to a new output file for the policy.

When you run the command, the resource's allow policy is either printed to the console or exported to the specified file.

### REST

To see who has access to your resource, get the resource's allow policy. To learn how to interpret allow policies, see [Understanding allow policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies) .

> **Note:** A resource's allow policy does not show any roles gained through [policy inheritance](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/allow-policies#inheritance) . To view inherited roles, use the Google Cloud console, or follow the instructions on [Viewing effective IAM policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/view-effective-iam-policies) .

To get the resource's allow policy, use the resource's `getIamPolicy` method.

The HTTP method, URL, and request body depend on the resource that you want to view access to. To find these details, find the API reference for the service that owns the resource, then find the reference for the resource's `getIamPolicy` method. For example, the HTTP method, URL, and request body for a Compute Engine instance are specified in the [instances `getIamPolicy` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/getIamPolicy) .

The response for any resource's `getIamPolicy` method contains the resource's allow policy.

## Grant or revoke a single IAM role

You can use the Google Cloud console and the gcloud CLI to quickly grant or revoke a single role for a single principal, without editing the resource's allow policy directly. Common types of principals include Google Accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains. For a list of all principal types, see [Principal types](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principals-overview#principal-types) .

> **Note:** If the [`iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-domains) organization policy constraint is enforced in your organization, then you might not be able to grant roles to newly created groups. If you get a `failedPrecondition` error when trying to grant a role to a newly created group, wait 24 hours, and then try granting the role again.

In general, policy changes take effect within 2 minutes. However, in some cases, it can take 7 minutes or more for changes to propagate across the system.

If you need help to identify the most appropriate predefined role, see [Find the right predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/choose-predefined-roles) .

### Grant a single IAM role

To grant a single role to a principal, do the following:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the page listing the resource that you want to view access to.
    
    For example, to manage access to a Compute Engine instance, go to the **VM instances** page.

2.  Select the checkbox next to the resource that you want to manage access to.

3.  Ensure that the info panel is visible. If it is not visible, click **Show info panel** .

4.  Select a principal to grant a role to:
    
      - To grant a role to a principal who already has other roles on the resource, find a row containing the principal, click edit **Edit principal** in that row, and click add **Add another role** .
        
        > **Note:** You cannot edit inherited roles when managing access to a resource. To edit inherited roles, go to the resource where the role was granted.
    
      - To grant a role to a principal who doesn't already have other roles on the resource, click person\_add **Add principal** , then enter an identifier for the principal—for example, `my-user@example.com` or `//iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/example-pool/group/example-group@example.com` .

5.  Click **Select a role** , then search for a role to grant based on the following:
    
      - The role name
      - The Google Cloud product that you want to grant access to
      - The permission that you want to give
      - The job function to perform
    
    To follow the principle of least privilege, [choose a role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/choose-predefined-roles) that includes only the permissions that your principal needs.

6.  Optional: Add a [condition](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview) to the role.

7.  Click **Save** . The principal is granted the role on the resource.

### gcloud

To quickly grant a role to a principal, run the `add-iam-policy-binding` command.

The format for this command varies depending on the resource type you're managing access to. To find the format for your resource, find the reference for the resource's `add-iam-policy-binding` command in the [Google Cloud CLI reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference) . This reference is organized by service, then resource. For example, to grant a principal a role on a Compute Engine instance, follow the format described in the [`gcloud compute instances add-iam-policy- binding` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/add-iam-policy-binding) .

> **Note:** If you grant access to a user's email alias or a secondary domain, then the values in your allow policy might not match the values that you initially entered. If you grant access to an email alias, then the allow policy displays the user's primary email address. If you grant access to a secondary domain, then the allow policy displays the primary domain.

### Revoke a single IAM role

To revoke a single role from a principal, do the following:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the page listing the resource that you want to revoke access from.
    
    For example, to manage access to a Compute Engine instance, go to the **VM instances** page:

2.  Select the checkbox next to the resource that you want to manage access to.

3.  Ensure that the info panel is visible. If it is not visible, click **Show info panel** .

4.  Find the row containing the principal whose access you want to revoke. Then click edit **Edit principal** in that row.
    
    > **Note:** You cannot edit inherited roles when managing access to a resource. To edit inherited roles, go to the resource where the role was granted.

5.  Click the **Delete** delete button for the role that you want to revoke, and then click **Save** .

### gcloud

To quickly revoke a role from a principal, run the `remove-iam-policy-binding` command.

The format for this command varies depending on the resource type you're managing access to. To find the format for your resource, find the reference for the resource's `remove-iam-policy-binding` command in the [Google Cloud CLI reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference) . This reference is organized by service, then resource. For example, to grant a principal a role on a Compute Engine instance, follow the format described in the [`gcloud compute instances remove-iam-policy-binding` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/remove-iam-policy-binding) .

## Grant or revoke multiple IAM roles using Google Cloud console

You can use the Google Cloud console to grant and revoke multiple roles for a single principal:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the page listing the resource that you want to view access to.
    
    For example, to manage access to a Compute Engine instance, go to the **VM instances** page.

2.  Select the checkbox next to the resource that you want to manage access to.

3.  If the info panel is not visible, click **Show info panel** .

4.  Select the principal whose roles you want to modify:
    
      - To modify roles for a principal who already has roles on the resource, find a row containing the principal, click edit **Edit principal** in that row, and click add **Add another role** .
        
        > **Note:** You cannot edit inherited roles when managing access to a resource. To edit inherited roles, go to the resource where the role was granted.
    
      - To grant roles to a principal who doesn't have any existing roles on the resource, click person\_add **Grant access** , then enter an identifier for the principal—for example, `my-user@example.com` or `//iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/example-pool/group/example-group@example.com` .

5.  Modify the principal's roles:
    
      - To grant a role to a principal who doesn't have any existing roles on the resource, click **Select a role** , then search for a role to grant.
      - To grant an additional role to the principal, click **Add another role** , then search for a role to grant.
      - To replace one of the principal's roles with a different role, click the existing role, then search for a different role to grant.
      - To revoke one of the principal's roles, click the **Delete** delete button for each role that you want to revoke.
    
    You can also [add a condition](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-conditional-role-bindings#add) to a role, [modify a role's condition](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-conditional-role-bindings#modify) , or [remove a role's condition](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-conditional-role-bindings#removing) .

6.  Click **Save** .

> **Note:** If you grant access to a user's email alias or a secondary domain, then the values in your allow policy might not match the values that you initially entered. If you grant access to an email alias, then the allow policy displays the user's primary email address. If you grant access to a secondary domain, then the allow policy displays the primary domain.

## Grant or revoke multiple IAM roles programmatically

To make large-scale access changes that involve granting and revoking multiple roles for multiple principals, use the *read-modify-write* pattern to update the resource's allow policy:

1.  Read the current allow policy by calling `getIamPolicy()` .
2.  Edit the allow policy, either by using a text editor or programmatically, to add or remove any principals or role bindings.
3.  Write the updated allow policy by calling `setIamPolicy()` .

This section shows how to use the gcloud CLI and the REST API to update the allow policy. You can also update the allow policy using the Google Cloud client libraries.

> **Note:** If the [`iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-domains) organization policy constraint is enforced in your organization, then you might not be able to grant roles to newly created groups. If you get a `failedPrecondition` error when trying to grant a role to a newly created group, wait 24 hours, and then try granting the role again.

In general, policy changes take effect within 2 minutes. However, in some cases, it can take 7 minutes or more for changes to propagate across the system.

### Get the current allow policy

### gcloud

To get the allow policy for the resource, run the `get-iam-policy` command for the resource.

The format for this command varies depending on the resource type you're managing access to. To find the format for your resource, find the reference for the resource's `get-iam-policy` command in the [Google Cloud CLI reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference) . This reference is organized by service, then resource. For example, to get the allow policy of a Compute Engine VM instance, follow the format described in the [`gcloud compute instances get-iam-policy` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/get-iam-policy) .

Optionally, add the following arguments to the command to specify the format and export the results:

    --format=FORMAT > PATH

Provide the following values:

  - `  FORMAT  ` : The desired format for the allow policy. Use `json` or `yaml` .
  - `  PATH  ` : The path to a new output file for the allow policy.

When you run the command, the resource's allow policy is either printed to the console or exported to the specified file.

### REST

To get the resource's allow policy, use the resource's `getIamPolicy` method.

The HTTP method, URL, and request body depend on the resource that you want to view access to. To find these details, find the API reference for the service that owns the resource, then find the reference for the resource's `getIamPolicy` method. For example, the HTTP method, URL, and request body for a Compute Engine VM instance are specified in the [instances `getIamPolicy` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/getIamPolicy) .

The response for any resource's `getIamPolicy` method contains the resource's allow policy. Save the response in a file of the appropriate type ( `json` or `yaml` ).

### Modify the allow policy

Programmatically or using a text editor, modify the local copy of your resource's allow policy to reflect the roles you want to grant or revoke.

To ensure that you do not overwrite other changes, do not edit or remove the allow policy's `etag` field. The `etag` field identifies the current state of the allow policy. When you [set the updated allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#setting-policy) , IAM compares the `etag` value in the request with the existing `etag` , and only writes the allow policy if the values match.

> **Important:** None of your changes will take effect until you [set the updated allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#setting-policy) .

To edit the roles that an allow policy grants, you need to edit the role bindings in the allow policy. Role bindings have the following format:

    {
      "role": "ROLE_NAME",
      "members": [
        "PRINCIPAL_1",
        "PRINCIPAL_2",
        ...
        "PRINCIPAL_N"
      ],
      "conditions:" {
        CONDITIONS
      }
    }

The placeholders have the following values:

  - `  ROLE_NAME  ` : The name of the role that you want to grant. Use one of the following formats:
    
      - Predefined roles: ` roles/ SERVICE . IDENTIFIER  `
      - Project-level custom roles: ` projects/ PROJECT_ID /roles/ IDENTIFIER  `
      - Organization-level custom roles: ` organizations/ ORG_ID /roles/ IDENTIFIER  `
    
    For a list of predefined roles, see [Understanding roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .

  - `  PRINCIPAL_1  ` , `  PRINCIPAL_2  ` , ` ... PRINCIPAL_N  ` : Identifiers for the principals that you want to grant the role to.
    
    Principal identifiers usually have the following form: `  PRINCIPAL-TYPE : ID  ` . For example, `user:my-user@example.com` or `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/example-pool/group/example-group@example.com` . For a full list of the values that `  PRINCIPAL  ` can have, see [Principal identifiers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-identifiers) .
    
    For the principal type `user` , the domain name in the identifier must be a Google Workspace domain or a Cloud Identity domain. To learn how to set up a Cloud Identity domain, see the [overview of Cloud Identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/identity/docs/overview) .

  - `  CONDITIONS  ` : Optional. Any [conditions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview) that specify when access will be granted.

#### Grant a role

To grant roles to your principals, modify the role bindings in the allow policy. To learn what roles you can grant, see [Understanding roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles) , or [view grantable roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/viewing-grantable-roles) for the resource. If you need help to identify the most appropriate predefined roles, see [Find the right predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/choose-predefined-roles) .

Optionally, you can use [conditions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/conditions-overview) to grant roles only when certain requirements are met.

To grant a role that is already included in the allow policy, add the principal to an existing role binding:

### gcloud

Edit the allow policy by adding the principal to an existing role binding. Note that this change will not take effect until you [set the updated allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#setting-policy) .

For example, imagine the allow policy contains the following role binding, which grants the Compute Instance Admin role ( `roles/compute.instanceAdmin` ) to Kai:

    {
      "role": "roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
      "members": [
        "user:kai@example.com"
      ]
    }

To grant that same role to Raha, add Raha's principal identifier to the existing role binding:

    {
      "role": "roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
      "members": [
        "user:kai@example.com",
        "user:raha@example.com"
      ]
    }

### REST

Edit the allow policy by adding the principal to an existing role binding. Note that this change will not take effect until you [set the updated allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#setting-policy) .

For example, imagine the allow policy contains the following role binding, which grants the Compute Instance Admin role ( `roles/compute.instanceAdmin` ) to Kai:

    {
      "role": "roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
      "members": [
        "user:kai@example.com"
      ]
    }

To grant that same role to Raha, add Raha's principal identifier to the existing role binding:

    {
      "role": "roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
      "members": [
        "user:kai@example.com",
        "user:raha@example.com"
      ]
    }

To grant a role that is not yet included in the allow policy, add a new role binding:

### gcloud

Edit the allow policy by adding a new role binding that grants the role to the principal. This change will not take effect until you [set the updated allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#setting-policy) .

For example, to grant the Compute Load Balancer Admin role ( `roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin` ) to Raha, add the following role binding to the `bindings` array for the allow policy:

    {
      "role": "roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin",
      "members": [
        "user:raha@example.com"
      ]
    }

### REST

Edit the allow policy by adding a new role binding that grants the role to the principal. This change will not take effect until you [set the updated allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#setting-policy) .

For example, to grant the Compute Load Balancer Admin role ( `roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin` ) to Raha, add the following role binding to the `bindings` array for the allow policy:

    {
      "role": "roles/compute.loadBalancerAdmin",
      "members": [
        "user:raha@example.com"
      ]
    }

#### Revoke a role

To revoke a role, remove the principal from the role binding. If there are no other principals in the role binding, remove the entire role binding.

> **Note:** Role bindings with no principals are not allowed and will result in an error when setting the allow policy.

### gcloud

Revoke a role by editing the JSON or YAML allow policy returned by the `get-iam-policy` command. This change will not take effect until you [set the updated allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#setting-policy) .

To revoke a role from a principal, delete the desired principals or bindings from the `bindings` array for the allow policy.

### REST

Revoke a role by editing the JSON or YAML allow policy returned by the `get-iam-policy` command. This change will not take effect until you [set the updated allow policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources#setting-policy) .

To revoke a role from a principal, delete the desired principals or bindings from the `bindings` array for the allow policy.

### Set the allow policy

After you modify the allow policy to grant and revoke the desired roles, call `setIamPolicy()` to make the updates.

> **Warning:** Setting a new allow policy permanently overwrites the existing allow policy on the resource. To avoid removing role bindings unintentionally, always follow the read-modify-write pattern when updating an allow policy: read the existing allow policy, modify it as needed, and then write the updated version of the allow policy.

### gcloud

To set the allow policy for the resource, run the `set-iam-policy` command for the resource.

The format for this command varies depending on the resource type you're managing access to. To find the format for your resource, find the reference for the resource's `set-iam-policy` command in the [Google Cloud CLI reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference) . This reference is organized by service, then resource. For example, to get the allow policy of a Compute Engine VM instance, follow the format described in the [`gcloud compute instances set-iam-policy` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/set-iam-policy) .

The response for any resource's `set-iam-policy` command contains the resource's updated allow policy.

> **Note:** If you treat policies as code and store them in a version-control system, you should store the policy that is returned, not the policy that you sent in the request.

### REST

To set the resource's allow policy, use the resource's `setIamPolicy` method.

The HTTP method, URL, and request body depend on the resource that you want to view access to. To find these details, find the API reference for the service that owns the resource, then find the reference for the resource's `setIamPolicy` method. For example, the HTTP method, URL, and request body for a Compute Engine VM instance are specified in the [instances `setIamPolicy` reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/getIamPolicy) .

The response for any resource's `setIamPolicy` method contains the resource's updated allow policy.

> **Note:** If you treat policies as code and store them in a version-control system, you should store the policy that is returned, not the policy that you sent in the request.

> **Note:** If you grant access to a user's email alias or a secondary domain, then the values in your allow policy might not match the values that you initially entered. If you grant access to an email alias, then the allow policy displays the user's primary email address. If you grant access to a secondary domain, then the allow policy displays the primary domain.
