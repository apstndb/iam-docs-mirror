title: Request temporary elevated access with Privileged Access Manager
description: Request for temporary elevated access with Privileged Access Manager.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

To temporarily elevate your privileges, you can request a grant against an *entitlement* in [Privileged Access Manager (PAM)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-overview) for a fixed duration.

An entitlement contains [roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles) that are granted to you after your grant request is successful. These roles are removed by Privileged Access Manager when the grant ends.

Keep the following in mind when you want to request a grant against an entitlement:

  - You can only request grants against entitlements that you have been added to. To be added to an entitlement, contact the principal administering the entitlement.

  - One user can have a maximum of 10 open grants per entitlement at a time. These grants can be in the `Active` , `Scheduled` , or `Approval awaited` state.

  - You can't request a grant with the same scope as an existing grant in the `Active` , `Scheduled` , or `Approval awaited` state.

  - You can't have two scheduled grants on the same entitlement if both their scopes and their activation times overlap. Also, you can't schedule a grant to start before an active grant with the same scope ends.

  - Depending on how it's set up, a grant request might require approval to be granted.

  - If a grant request needs approval, it must be approved or denied before it expires. The deadline depends on the activation type:
    
      - Immediate activation: Within 24 hours of the request.
      - Scheduled activation: Before the scheduled activation time.
    
    If a request isn't approved or denied by the deadline, its status changes to `Expired` .

  - Successful grant requests might take a few minutes to take effect.

## Request a grant

### Console

1.  Go to the **Privileged Access Manager** page.

2.  Select the organization, folder, or project where you want to request a grant.

3.  In the **My entitlements** tab, find the entitlement to request against, and then click **Request grant** in the same row.
    
    For entitlements that are inherited from a parent folder or organization, the scope of the grant is automatically adjusted to the selected organization, folder, or project. You can request a grant against the inherited entitlement at the child resource level. This feature is available in [preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

4.  If the Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier is activated, then you can customize the scope of your grant request to include only some specific roles and resources. This feature is available in [preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .
    
    1.  Turn on the **Customize scope** toggle.
    2.  Add the required resource filters. You can add up to five resource filters.
    3.  Select the required roles.

5.  Provide the following details:
    
      - The duration required for the grant, up to the maximum duration set on the entitlement.
    
      - Optional: To schedule the grant for a later time, click **Schedule grants** and specify an activation time up to seven days in advance. If you don't schedule the grant, it activates immediately after creation or approval.
    
      - If required, a justification for the grant.
    
      - Optional: Email addresses for notifications.
        
        Google identities associated with the entitlement, like approvers and requesters, are automatically notified. However, if you want to notify additional people, then you can add their email addresses. This is especially useful if you're using [workforce identities](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation) instead of Google Accounts.

6.  Click **Request grant** .

### REST

1.  Search for entitlements you're eligible to request.  
    
    The Privileged Access Manager API's `  searchEntitlements  ` method with the `GRANT_REQUESTER` caller access type searches for entitlements you can request a grant against.
    
    Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:
    
      - `  SCOPE  ` : The organization, folder, or project that the entitlement is in, in the format of ` organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID  ` , ` folders/ FOLDER_ID  ` , or ` projects/ PROJECT_ID  ` . Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .
      - `  FILTER  ` : Optional. Returns entitlements whose field values match an [AIP-160 expression](https://google.aip.dev/160) .
      - `  PAGE_SIZE  ` : Optional. The number of items to return in a response.
      - `  PAGE_TOKEN  ` : Optional. Which page to start the response from, using a page token returned in a previous response.

### gcloud

The `  gcloud alpha pam grants search  ` command used with the `had-created` caller relationship searches for grants you have created. To check their status, look for the `state` field in the response.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud alpha pam grants search \
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID \
        --caller-relationship=had-created \
        --location=global \
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud alpha pam grants search `
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID `
        --caller-relationship=had-created `
        --location=global `
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud alpha pam grants search ^
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID ^
        --caller-relationship=had-created ^
        --location=global ^
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

### REST

The Privileged Access Manager API's `  searchGrants  ` method used with the `HAD_CREATED` caller relationship searches for grants you have created. To check their status, look for the `state` field in the response.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  SCOPE  ` : The organization, folder, or project that the entitlement is in, in the format of ` organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID  ` , ` folders/ FOLDER_ID  ` , or ` projects/ PROJECT_ID  ` . Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .
  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  FILTER  ` : Optional. Returns grants whose field values match an [AIP-160 expression](https://google.aip.dev/160) .
  - `  PAGE_SIZE  ` : Optional. The number of items to return in a response.
  - `  PAGE_TOKEN  ` : Optional. Which page to start the response from, using a page token returned in a previous response.

HTTP method and URL:

    GET https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1beta/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants:search?callerRelationship=HAD_CREATED&filter=FILTER&pageSize=PAGE_SIZE&pageToken=PAGE_TOKEN

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    curl -X GET \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         "https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1beta/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants:search?callerRelationship=HAD_CREATED&filter=FILTER&pageSize=PAGE_SIZE&pageToken=PAGE_TOKEN"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method GET `
