title: Revoke grants in Privileged Access Manager
description: Use Privileged Access Manager (PAM) to manage just-in-time temporary privilege elevation for select principals, and view audit logs to find out who had access to what and when.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

After a principal has successfully [requested a grant](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-request-temporary-elevated-access) against an entitlement and it is active, principals with the `privilegedaccessmanager.grants.revoke` permission can revoke the grant. Grants that don't have an active status can't be revoked.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have [enabled Privileged Access Manager and set up permissions for it](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-permissions-and-setup) .

## Revoke grants using the Google Cloud console

To revoke a specific grant made against an entitlement, complete the following instructions:

1.  Go to the **Privileged Access Manager** page.

2.  Select the organization, folder, or project you want to revoke grants in.

3.  Click the **Grants** tab, followed by the **Grants for all users** tab. This contains all grants across all requesters, the grant statuses, and their associated entitlement details.

4.  In the table, click more\_vert **More options** in the same row as a grant you want to revoke.

5.  To revoke an active grant, click **Revoke grant** .

To revoke all active grants made against an entitlement, complete the following instructions:

1.  Go to the **Privileged Access Manager** page.

2.  Click the **Entitlements** tab, followed by the **Entitlements for all users** tab. Here you can find the available entitlements, the roles they grant, and their valid requesters and approvers.

3.  In the table, click more\_vert **More options** in the same row as an entitlement you want to revoke the grants for.

4.  Click **Revoke all grants** .

## Revoke grants programmatically

### gcloud

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  GRANT_ID  ` : The ID of the grant you want to revoke. You can retrieve the ID by [viewing grants](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-view-grants) .
  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  REVOKE_REASON  ` : Why the grant has been revoked.
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud pam grants revoke \
         GRANT_ID \
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID \
        --reason="REVOKE_REASON" \
        --location=global \
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud pam grants revoke `
         GRANT_ID `
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID `
        --reason="REVOKE_REASON" `
        --location=global `
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud pam grants revoke ^
         GRANT_ID ^
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID ^
        --reason="REVOKE_REASON" ^
        --location=global ^
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

### REST

The Privileged Access Manager API's `revokeGrant` method revokes an active grant.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  SCOPE  ` : The organization, folder, or project that the entitlement is in, in the format of ` organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID  ` , ` folders/ FOLDER_ID  ` , or ` projects/ PROJECT_ID  ` . Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .
  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  GRANT_ID  ` : The ID of the grant you want to revoke. You can retrieve the ID by [viewing grants](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-view-grants) .
  - `  REVOKE_REASON  ` : The reason the grant was revoked.

HTTP method and URL:

    POST https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID:revoke

Request JSON body:

    {
      "reason": "REVOKE_REASON"
    }

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Save the request body in a file named `request.json` , and execute the following command:

    curl -X POST \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
         -d @request.json \
         "https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID:revoke"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Save the request body in a file named `request.json` , and execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method POST `
        -Headers $headers `

        -InFile request.json `
        -Uri "https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID:revoke" | Select-Object -Expand Content

You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:

    {
      "name": "projects/my-project/locations/global/operations/OPERATION_ID",
