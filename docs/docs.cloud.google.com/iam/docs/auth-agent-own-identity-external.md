> This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](https://docs.cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

Agents hosted on Google Cloud can use their own identity to authenticate to tools and services hosted on Google Cloud runtimes, such as Cloud Run or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), by requesting an OpenID Connect (OIDC) ID token from Agent Identity. Agents can also use these ID tokens to authenticate to third-party cloud platforms (such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure), custom APIs, API gateways, and on-premises backends.

When an agent acts on its own authority to access an external service, Agent Identity issues an OpenID Connect (OIDC) ID token. This JSON Web Token (JWT) asserts the agent's [SPIFFE identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/agent-identity-overview#spiffe-identity) and is signed by the issuer keys for the agent's trust domain (managed workload identity pool). External systems can verify these tokens without Google Cloud credentials or SDKs through public endpoints hosted by the Google Cloud Security Token Service:

- An **OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 endpoint** ( `/.well-known/openid-configuration` ) that publishes the OpenID provider metadata and the public key endpoint ( `jwks_uri` ).
- A **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint** ( `/openid/jwks` ) that serves the active public keys used to verify signatures on agent ID tokens.

> **Note:** If you want your agent to access Google Cloud APIs and resources using its own identity, see [Authenticate to Google Cloud using an agent's own identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity) . If you want your agent to access services on behalf of an end user, see [Authenticate using 3-legged OAuth with auth manager](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-with-3lo-v2) .

## Before you begin

1.  [Verify that you have chosen the correct authentication method](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/agent-identity-overview#auth-models) . Review how [SPIFFE identities, trust domains](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/agent-identity-overview#spiffe-identity) , and [agent credentials](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/agent-identity-overview#agent-credentials) work in the [Agent Identity overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/agent-identity-overview) .
2.  [Create and deploy an agent](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/create-and-deploy-agent) with Agent Identity enabled.
3.  Ensure that your external service or identity provider meets the following requirements:
    - Supports validating [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) using [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) and [JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) .
    - Can send outbound HTTPS requests to `https://sts.googleapis.com` to retrieve the OpenID Provider metadata and public signing keys.
4.  Identify the following configuration values for your agent and target external service:
    - **Issuer URL ( `iss` claim)** : The workload identity pool issuer URL for your organization ( `https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ `` ORGANIZATION_ID `` /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ `` TRUST_DOMAIN` ) or project ( `https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/projects/ `` PROJECT_NUMBER `` /locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/ `` TRUST_DOMAIN` ).
    - **Allowed audience ( `aud` claim)** : The audience URI that the external service or identity provider expects when validating ID tokens.
5.  [Verify that you have the roles required to complete this task](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#req-roles) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to deploy an agent with Agent Identity, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project:

- Deploy an agent to Agent Runtime on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform: [Vertex AI User](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/aiplatform#aiplatform.user) ( `roles/aiplatform.user` )
- Deploy an agent service to Cloud Run: [Cloud Run Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/run#run.admin) ( `roles/run.admin` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to deploy an agent with Agent Identity. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to deploy an agent with Agent Identity:

- Deploy an agent to Agent Runtime on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform:
  - `aiplatform.reasoningEngines.create`
  - `aiplatform.reasoningEngines.update`
- Deploy an agent service to Cloud Run:
  - `run.services.create`
  - `run.services.update`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

> **Note:** External services and third-party verifiers don't need any IAM roles or Google Cloud credentials to verify OIDC ID tokens issued by Agent Identity. The OpenID Connect Discovery ( `/.well-known/openid-configuration` ) and JSON Web Key Set ( `/openid/jwks` ) endpoints are public and unauthenticated.

## Obtain an OIDC ID token for an agent

To configure your agent to obtain and send an OIDC ID token to an external service, complete the following tasks:

1.  [Configure your agent with Agent Identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#configure-agent)
2.  [Request an OIDC ID token in application code](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#obtain-id-token)

### Configure your agent with Agent Identity

Enable Agent Identity when you deploy your agent:

- If you deploy your agent to Agent Runtime on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform , set `identity_type` to `AGENT_IDENTITY` :

  ```
  remote_app = client.agent_engines.create(
      agent=app,
      config={
          "identity_type": types.IdentityType.AGENT_IDENTITY,
          "requirements": ["google-cloud-aiplatform[agent_engines,adk]"],
      },
  )
  ```

- If you deploy a containerized agent service to Cloud Run, pass the `--identity-type=agent-identity` flag:

  ```
  gcloud run deploy SERVICE_NAME \
      --image=IMAGE_URL \
      --identity-type=agent-identity \
      --no-allow-unauthenticated
  ```

  Replace the following:

  - `SERVICE_NAME` : The name of your Cloud Run service.
  - `IMAGE_URL` : The container image URL for your agent.

### Request an OIDC ID token in application code

In your agent's application code, use the Google Auth client library to request an OIDC ID token for your target external audience. The client library handles token generation, local caching, and automatic renewal from the metadata server.

By default, OIDC ID tokens issued for external audiences aren't bound to the runtime certificate.

The following example uses the `google-auth` library to request an OIDC ID token and attach it as a `Bearer` token in an outgoing request:

### Python

```
from google.auth.transport.requests import AuthorizedSession
from google.oauth2 import id_token

# 1. Specify the audience expected by the external receiver
# (for example, AWS Bedrock AgentCore or your external service URL).
target_audience = "https://EXTERNAL_SERVICE_AUDIENCE"

# 2. Create ID token credentials and an AuthorizedSession, which handles
# local token caching, automatic renewal before expiry, and the Bearer header.
credentials = id_token.fetch_id_token_credentials(audience=target_audience)
authed_session = AuthorizedSession(credentials)

# 3. Send the authenticated request to the external service.
response = authed_session.post(
    "https://EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ENDPOINT",
    json={"prompt": "Hello from Agent"},
)
```

Replace the following:

- `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_AUDIENCE` : The audience URI expected by your receiving service (for example, `bedrock.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` or `api.example.com` ).
- `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` : The URL of the external API or backend endpoint that your agent calls.

For client library instructions and examples in other programming languages (including Go, Node.js, and Java), see [Get an ID token](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/get-id-token) . Current client library versions for these languages support `--identity-type=agent-identity` , but don't use bound tokens by default.

## Verify Agent Identity ID tokens

When an external service receives an OIDC ID token from your agent, verify the token using either of the following approaches based on the target service:

- **Managed cloud platforms (such as Cloud Run, AWS, or Microsoft Azure)** : [Use built-in workload identity federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#cloud-federation) to verify incoming tokens without writing custom verification code.
- **Custom backend services, API gateways, and on-premises workloads** : [Verify tokens programmatically](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#programmatic-verification) using the public OpenID Connect Discovery and JWKS endpoints.

### Use built-in workload identity federation

If your receiving service runs on a cloud platform that supports built-in IAM authentication or OIDC workload identity federation, you don't need to write custom token verification code:

- **Cloud Run** : If your receiving service runs on Cloud Run with authenticated ingress ( `--no-allow-unauthenticated` ), Cloud Run validates incoming Agent Identity tokens at the ingress layer. [Grant the calling agent](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity#grant-access) the Cloud Run Invoker ( `roles/run.invoker` ) role on the receiving service. For more information, see [Authenticate to MCP servers on Cloud Run](https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/ai/authenticate-agents#authenticate-mcp-servers) .

  If your service allows unauthenticated ingress and verifies tokens in application code, see [Verify tokens programmatically](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#programmatic-verification) .

- **Amazon Bedrock** : Configure inbound JWT authentication by specifying the Google Cloud Security Token Service discovery URL or issuer URL and your expected audience. For instructions, see [Configure inbound JWT authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/inbound-jwt-authorizer.html) in the AWS documentation.

- **Microsoft Entra ID** : Configure a federated identity credential with the **Other issuer** scenario. Specify the Google Cloud Security Token Service issuer URL, the expected audience, and the subject identifier ( `sub` claim). For instructions, see [Create a trust relationship between an app and an external identity provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust) in the Microsoft Learn documentation.

### Verify tokens programmatically

If your agent sends requests to a custom API, microservice, API gateway, or on-premises workload, your receiving service must verify the incoming OIDC ID token before granting access. Your agent typically passes this token in the `Authorization: Bearer `` TOKEN` HTTP header.

To verify incoming ID tokens programmatically, complete the following tasks:

1.  [Extract and validate the token issuer URL](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#extract-issuer)
2.  [Discover and cache the public signing keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#discover-public-keys)
3.  [Verify the token signature and claims](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#verify-signature-claims)
4.  [Authorize the agent's SPIFFE identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/auth-agent-own-identity-external#authorize-agent)

#### Extract and validate the token issuer URL

When an incoming request arrives, read the unverified JWT payload to extract the `iss` (issuer) claim. This claim contains the URL of the workload identity pool for the agent's [trust domain](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/agent-identity-overview#spiffe-identity) . This URL serves as the base URL for the discovery document and public signing keys.

Before making any outgoing network requests, verify that the `iss` claim matches the expected Google Cloud Security Token Service workload identity pool URL for your organization or project:

- **Organization-level trust domains** :

  ```
  https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/TRUST_DOMAIN
  ```

  For example, for an organization with ID `123456789012` , `TRUST_DOMAIN` is `agents.global.org-123456789012.system.id.goog` .

- **Project-level trust domains** (for projects without an organization):

  ```
  https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/TRUST_DOMAIN
  ```

  For example, for a project with number `9876543210` , `TRUST_DOMAIN` is `agents.global.proj-9876543210.system.id.goog` .

> **Caution:** Always validate that the `iss` URL starts with `https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/` and belongs to a trusted Google Cloud organization or project before sending HTTP requests to the discovery endpoint.

#### Discover and cache the public signing keys

After you validate the issuer URL, retrieve and cache the public signing keys from the Google Cloud Security Token Service:

1.  **Query the OpenID Connect Discovery endpoint** : Append `/.well-known/openid-configuration` to the base issuer URL and send an unauthenticated HTTP `GET` request:

    Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

    - `ORGANIZATION_ID` : Your Google Cloud organization ID. For a project without an organization, replace `organizations/ `` ORGANIZATION_ID` with `projects/ `` PROJECT_NUMBER` .
    - `TRUST_DOMAIN` : The workload identity pool ID for your agent's trust domain (for example, `agents.global.org-123456789012.system.id.goog` ).

    HTTP method and URL:

    ```
    GET https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/TRUST_DOMAIN/.well-known/openid-configuration
    ```

    To send your request, expand one of these options:

    #### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

    Execute the following command:

    ```
    curl -X GET \
         "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/TRUST_DOMAIN/.well-known/openid-configuration"
    ```

    #### PowerShell (Windows)

    Execute the following command:

    ```
    $headers = @{  }

    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method GET `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Uri "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/TRUST_DOMAIN/.well-known/openid-configuration" | Select-Object -Expand Content
    ```

    A successful request returns an `HTTP 200 OK` status and a JSON object containing the [OpenID Provider metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationResponse) , including the `jwks_uri` field:

    ```
    {
      "issuer": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/123456789012/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/agents.global.org-123456789012.system.id.goog",
      "jwks_uri": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/123456789012/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/agents.global.org-123456789012.system.id.goog/openid/jwks",
      "authorization_endpoint": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/123456789012/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/agents.global.org-123456789012.system.id.goog/authorize",
      "token_endpoint": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/123456789012/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/agents.global.org-123456789012.system.id.goog/token",
      "response_types_supported": [
        "id_token"
      ],
      "subject_types_supported": [
        "public"
      ],
      "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
        "RS256"
      ]
    }
    ```

2.  **Query the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint** : Send an unauthenticated HTTP `GET` request to the `jwks_uri` URL returned in the OpenID Provider metadata:

    Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

    - `ORGANIZATION_ID` : Your Google Cloud organization ID. For a project without an organization, replace `organizations/ `` ORGANIZATION_ID` with `projects/ `` PROJECT_NUMBER` .
    - `TRUST_DOMAIN` : The workload identity pool ID for your agent's trust domain (for example, `agents.global.org-123456789012.system.id.goog` ).

    HTTP method and URL:

    ```
    GET https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/TRUST_DOMAIN/openid/jwks
    ```

    To send your request, expand one of these options:

    #### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

    Execute the following command:

    ```
    curl -X GET \
         "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/TRUST_DOMAIN/openid/jwks"
    ```

    #### PowerShell (Windows)

    Execute the following command:

    ```
    $headers = @{  }

    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method GET `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Uri "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/TRUST_DOMAIN/openid/jwks" | Select-Object -Expand Content
    ```

    A successful request returns an `HTTP 200 OK` status and a JSON object containing an array of public keys formatted according to [RFC 7517](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-4) :

    ```
    {
      "keys": [
        {
          "kty": "RSA",
          "use": "sig",
          "alg": "RS256",
          "kid": "4d1933f8e6c4e0b512c140989f6655c68997...",
          "n": "uQn4zN_1mQ0VpGv82-Wp3w...",
          "e": "AQAB"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3.  **Cache the discovery document and keys** : Responses from both the OpenID Connect Discovery endpoint and the JWKS endpoint include the following HTTP cache header:

    ```
    Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, must-revalidate
    ```

    Cache the discovery document and JWKS for up to 24 hours ( `86400` seconds) to improve verification performance and avoid rate limiting.

    Google Cloud periodically rotates the private and public signing keys for workload identity pools. If your verifier receives an incoming token with a `kid` (key ID) that isn't in its local key cache, fetch a fresh JWKS from the `/openid/jwks` endpoint before rejecting the token.

    If you encounter HTTP errors when querying the discovery or JWKS endpoints, see [Troubleshoot Agent Identity authentication issues](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/troubleshoot-auth-manager#oidc-jwks-errors) .

#### Verify the token signature and claims

To cryptographically verify the token signature and validate the JWT claims, use a standard OIDC or JWT verification library (such as [Google Tink](https://developers.google.com/tink) ) and do the following:

1.  **Signature** : Find the public key in the cached JWKS that matches the `kid` (key ID) in the JWT header. Validate the signature using the algorithm specified in the `alg` field ( `RS256` ). For forward compatibility, inspect the `alg` and `kty` fields in the JWKS dynamically rather than hardcoding algorithm types.
2.  **Issuer ( `iss` )** : Confirm that the `iss` claim matches the trusted Google Cloud workload identity pool issuer URL for your trust domain.
3.  **Audience ( `aud` )** : Confirm that the `aud` claim matches your service's configured audience identifier.
4.  **Issued-at time ( `iat` ) and expiration time ( `exp` )** : Verify that the `iat` claim is in the past and that the current time is earlier than the `exp` claim (allowing a small clock-skew tolerance, such as 1 to 2 minutes).

The following example uses Google Tink ( `tink.jwt` ) to verify an Agent Identity ID token against a JWKS JSON payload:

### Python

```
import tink
from tink import jwt

# Initialize Tink JWT signature primitives (call once at application startup).
jwt.register_jwt_signature()


def verify_agent_identity_token(
    token: str,
    jwks_json: str,
    expected_issuer: str,
    expected_audience: str,
) -> jwt.VerifiedJwt:
    """Verifies an Agent Identity JWT against a JWKS JSON string using Tink.

    Args:
        token: The compact serialized JWT string.
        jwks_json: The JWKS JSON string fetched from the STS pool endpoint.
        expected_issuer: The expected token issuer ('iss' claim).
        expected_audience: The expected token audience ('aud' claim).

    Returns:
        jwt.VerifiedJwt: The verified JWT claims object.

    Raises:
        tink.TinkError: If the JWKS cannot be parsed, the key is not found,
            or token validation (signature, issuer, audience, expiration) fails.
    """
    # 1. Convert the JWKS JSON into a Tink public KeysetHandle.
    keyset_handle = jwt.jwk_set_to_public_keyset_handle(jwks_json)

    # 2. Instantiate the Tink JwtPublicKeyVerify primitive.
    jwt_verifier = keyset_handle.primitive(jwt.JwtPublicKeyVerify)

    # 3. Configure expected validation rules (issuer, audience, expiration).
    # Google Cloud STS sets 'typ': 'JWT' in the header, so
    # expected_type_header="JWT" is required.
    validator = jwt.new_validator(
        expected_issuer=expected_issuer,
        expected_audience=expected_audience,
        expected_type_header="JWT",
        allow_missing_expiration=False,
    )

    # 4. Cryptographically verify the signature and standard OIDC claims.
    return jwt_verifier.verify_and_decode(token, validator)
```

#### Authorize the agent's SPIFFE identity

After you verify the token's signature and standard claims, inspect the verified `sub` (subject) claim to authorize the request and record the calling agent in your audit logs.

The `sub` claim contains the agent's unique [SPIFFE ID](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/agent-identity-overview#spiffe-identity) , for example:

```
  spiffe://agents.global.org-123456789012.system.id.goog/resources/aiplatform/projects/9876543210/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/my-test-agent
```

In your service's authorization logic, compare the verified `sub` claim against an allowlist of trusted agent SPIFFE IDs (or trust domain prefixes) before granting access to protected resources.
