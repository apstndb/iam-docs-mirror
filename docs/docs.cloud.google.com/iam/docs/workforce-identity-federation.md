With Workforce Identity Federation, users in your external identity provider (IdP) can use single sign-on (SSO) to access Google Cloud resources.

## What is Workforce Identity Federation?

Workforce Identity Federation lets you use your external identity provider (IdP) to authenticate your workforce— *users* and *groups* of users, such as employees, partners, and contractors. Your users can then access Google Cloud using single sign-on (SSO), through your IdP. You can use Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to [authorize your workforce users to access Google Cloud services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-principal-identifiers) .

### Federation versus synchronization

Workforce Identity Federation federates identities from your IdP, so it doesn't store user accounts in Google Cloud. Because of this, Workforce Identity Federation is syncless, meaning that you don't need to use tools to synchronize user identities from your IdP to Google-managed identities that require Google Accounts. For example, by using Workforce Identity Federation, you don't need to use Cloud Identity's [Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS)](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/dirsync/) .

### Workforce Identity Federation versus Workload Identity Federation

Workforce Identity Federation federates user identities whereas Workload Identity Federation federates workload identities.

For more information, see [Workload Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation) .

### Attribute-based access

Workforce Identity Federation extends Google Cloud's identity capabilities to support attribute-based access. In some IdPs, attributes are also known as *claims* or *assertions* .

After user authentication, attributes that are received from the IdP are used to determine the scope of access to the Google Cloud resources.

### Supported protocols

You can use Workforce Identity Federation with any IdP that supports [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/) or [SAML 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html) , such as Microsoft Entra ID, Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Okta, and others.

## Key concepts

This section describes the key concepts of Workforce Identity Federation.

### Workforce identity pools

Workforce identity pools let you manage groups of workforce identities and their access to Google Cloud resources.

Pools let you do the following:

  - Group user identities; for example, `employees` or `partners`
  - Grant IAM access to an entire pool or a subset thereof.
  - Federate identities from one or more IdPs.
  - Define policies on a group of users that require similar access permissions.
  - Specify IdP-specific configuration information, including [attribute mapping](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-mappings) and [attribute conditions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-conditions) .
  - Enable the Google Cloud CLI and API access for third-party identities.
  - Log access by users within a pool to Cloud Audit Logs, along with the pool ID.

You can create multiple pools. For an example that describes one such approach, see [Example: Multiple workforce identity pools](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#example-multiple-workforce-pools) .

Pools are configured at the [Google Cloud organization level](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#organizations) , which motivates the following considerations:

  - When you first set up Workforce Identity Federation for your organization, provide a unique ID for the pool. The pool ID must be globally unique across all workforce identity pools in Google Cloud, and should clearly describe the identities it contains.
  - If you have the appropriate IAM permissions to view the pool, it can be referenced by its ID across all projects and folders within the organization.

### Workforce identity pool providers

A workforce identity pool provider is an entity that describes a relationship between your Google Cloud organization and your IdP.

Workforce Identity Federation follows the [OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange specification (RFC 8693)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693) . You provide a credential from your external identity provider to the Security Token Service, which verifies the identity in the credential, and then returns a short-lived Google Cloud access token in exchange.

### OIDC flow types

For OIDC providers, Workforce Identity Federation supports both [authorization code flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth) and [implicit flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth) . Authorization code flow is considered to be the most secure, because tokens are returned from the IdP in a separate, secure backend transaction, directly from the IdP to Google Cloud, after users authenticate. As a result, code flow transactions can retrieve tokens of any size, so you can have more claims to use for attribute mapping and attribute condition. In implicit flow, by comparison, the ID Token is returned from the IdP to the browser. Tokens are subject to individual browser URL size limits.

### Google Cloud Workforce Identity Federation console

Users in a [workforce identity pool](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-identity-pools) can [access the Google Cloud Workforce Identity Federation console, also known as the console (federated)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-console-sso) . The console provides these users with UI access to Google Cloud [products that support Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/federated-identity-supported-services) .

### Attributes

Your IdP provides attributes, referred to by some IdPs as *claims* . Attributes contain information about your users. You can use these attributes in [attribute mappings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-mappings) and [attribute conditions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-conditions) .

#### Attribute mappings

> **Note:** If you use SCIM, you must also configure claim mapping for your SCIM tenant. For more information, see [SCIM provisioning for Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation-scim) .

You can map these attributes for use by Google Cloud using [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) .

This section describes the set of required and optional attributes that Google Cloud provides.

You can also define custom attributes in your IdP that can then be used by specific Google Cloud products; for example in IAM allow policies.

The maximum size for attribute mappings is 16 KB. If the size of attribute mappings exceeds the 16 KB limit, the sign-in attempt will fail.

The attributes are as follows:

  - `google.subject` (Required): a unique identifier for the authenticating user. It is *often the subject assertion of the JWT* , because Cloud Audit Logs logs record the contents of this field as the principal. You can use this field to configure IAM for authorization decisions. We recommend that you don't use a mutable value because if you change the value in your IdP's user directory, the user loses access.
    
    The maximum length is 127 bytes.

  - `google.groups` (Optional): the collection of groups that the authenticating user is a member of. You can configure a logic expression using a subset of CEL that produces *an array of strings* . You can also use this field to configure IAM for authorization decisions. Limitations for `google.groups` are as follows:
    
      - We recommend that you limit the group name to 40 characters.
    
      - If a single user belongs to more than 400 groups, that user's sign-in attempt will fail. To mitigate this, you must define a smaller set of groups in the assertion, and map only those groups that are used to federate the user to Google Cloud.
    
      - If you use this attribute to grant access in IAM, every member in the mapped groups is granted access. Therefore, we recommend that you ensure that only authorized users in your organization can modify the membership of the mapped groups.

  - `google.display_name` (Optional): attribute that is *used to set the name* of the signed-in user in the Google Cloud console. This attribute can't be used in IAM allow policies nor in the attribute condition.
    
    The maximum length is 100 bytes.

  - `google.profile_photo` (Optional): a URL of the user's thumbnail photo. We recommend the photo to be 400x400 pixels. When this attribute is set, the image is visible as the user's profile picture in the Google Cloud console. If this value isn't set, or it can't be fetched, a generic user icon is displayed instead. This attribute can't be used in either IAM allow policies or in the attribute condition.

  - `google.posix_username` (Optional): a unique POSIX-compliant username string used for the following:
    
      - [SSH-in-browser](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ssh-in-browser) .
    
    \+ [OS Login with Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin/manage-oslogin-in-an-org#use_workforce_identity_federation_with_os_login) ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) ).
    
    This attribute can't be used in IAM allow policies or in the attribute condition. The maximum length is 32 characters.

\* `google.email` (Optional): an attribute that is used to map email addresses of signed-in, federated users from the IdP to products that you integrate using [Workforce Identity Federation OAuth client integration](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-oauth-app) . This attribute can't be used in IAM allow policies or in the attribute condition.

For example, to map email addresses from Okta using the OIDC protocol, include `google.email=assertion.email` in your attribute mapping.

Example Google Cloud products that support OAuth client integration include the following:

  - [Identity-Aware Proxy with Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iap/docs/use-workforce-identity-federation)

  - [Secure Source Manager with Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/secure-source-manager/docs/create-instance-federated-identities)

  - ` attribute. KEY  ` (Optional): an external IdP-defined attribute that is present in a user's IdP token. You can use the custom attribute to define your authorization strategy in an IAM allow policy.
    
    For example, in your IdP, you can choose to define an attribute such as the user's cost center as `costcenter = "1234"` , and then refer to the principal in the following way:
    
        principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/attribute.costcenter/1234
    
    After you grant access on Google Cloud resources to this principal identifier, all identities that are configured in the IdP to have the `costcenter` attribute set to `1234` have access to the resources.
    
    You can configure a maximum of 50 custom attribute mapping rules. The maximum size of each such rule is 2048 characters.
    
    Although we don't have restrictions on the attributes you can map here, we strongly recommend that you choose attributes whose values are stable. For example, an attribute like `attribute.job_description` might change for many reasons (such as improving its readability). As an alternative, consider using `attribute.role` . Changes to the latter indicate a change of assigned responsibility and align with changes in the access granted to the user.

You can transform attribute values using [standard CEL functions](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md) . You can also use the following custom functions:

  - [`split` function](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/ext#readme-split) splits a string on the provided separator value. For example, to extract the attribute `username` from an email address attribute by splitting its value at the `@` and using the first string, use the following attribute mapping:
    
        attribute.username=assertion.email.split("@")[0]

  - [`join` function](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/cel-go/ext#readme-join) joins a list of strings on the provided separator value. For example, to populate the custom attribute `department` by concatenating a list of strings with `.` as a separator, use the following attribute mapping:
    
        attribute.department=assertion.department.join(".")

#### Attribute conditions

Attribute conditions are optional CEL expressions that let you set constraints on the identity attributes that Google Cloud accepts.

> **Warning:** If your multi-tenant IdP has a single issuer URI, you must use [attribute conditions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-conditions) to ensure that access is restricted to the correct tenant. For more information, see [Use attribute conditions when federating with GitHub or other multi-tenant identity providers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#use-attribute-conditions-multitenant) .

The benefits of using attribute conditions include the following:

  - You can use attribute conditions to allow only a subset of external identities to authenticate to your Google Cloud project. For example, you might want to allow only those identities that are in a specific team to sign in, especially if you are using a public IdP. For another example, you might want to allow your accounting team to sign in, but not your engineering team.
  - Attribute conditions let you prevent credentials intended for use with another platform from being used with Google Cloud, and vice-versa. This helps avoid the [confused deputy problem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem) .

#### Attribute conditions for multi-tenant IdPs

Workforce Identity Federation doesn't maintain a directory of user accounts; instead, it implements claims-based identities. As a result, when two tokens are issued by the same identity provider (IdP) and their claims map to the same `google.subject` value, the two tokens are assumed to identify the same user. To find out which IdP issued a token, Workforce Identity Federation inspects and verifies the token's issuer URL.

Multi-tenant IdPs, such as GitHub and Terraform Cloud, use a single issuer URL across all of their tenants. For these providers, the issuer URL identifies all of GitHub or Terraform Cloud, not a specific GitHub or Terraform Cloud organization.

When you use these identity providers, it's insufficient to let Workforce Identity Federation check a token's issuer URL to ensure that it comes from a trusted source and that its claims can be trusted. If your multi-tenant IdP has a single issuer URL, you must use attribute conditions to ensure that access is restricted to the correct tenant.

### Detailed audit logging

*Detailed audit logging* is a feature of Workforce Identity Federation that logs attributes that were received from your IdP to Cloud Audit Logs.

You can enable detailed audit logging when you create your workforce identity pool provider.

To learn how to troubleshoot attribute mapping errors with detailed audit logging, see [General attribute mapping errors](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/troubleshooting-workforce-identity-federation#general-attribute-mapping-errors) .

### JSON web keys

The workforce pool provider can access [JSON web keys (JWKs)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517) that are provided by your IdP in the `jwks_uri` field in the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` document. If your OIDC provider doesn't provide this information, or your issuer is not publicly accessible, you can manually upload the JWKs when you create or update the OIDC provider.

### SCIM support

> **Important:** This feature applies only to Gemini Enterprise.

If your identity provider (IdP) supports the [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_for_Cross-domain_Identity_Management) , you can configure your IdP to provision and manage groups in Google Cloud.

For more information, see [SCIM provisioning for Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation-scim) .

## Workforce principal identifiers for IAM policies

The following table shows the principal identifiers that you can use to grant roles to individual users and groups of users.

| Identities                                               | Identifier format                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single identity in a workforce identity pool             | ` principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/         POOL_ID        /subject/         SUBJECT_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE        `                              |
| All workforce identities in a group                      | ` principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/         POOL_ID        /group/         GROUP_ID        `                                            |
| All workforce identities with a specific attribute value | ` principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/         POOL_ID        /attribute.         ATTRIBUTE_NAME        /         ATTRIBUTE_VALUE        ` |
| All identities in a workforce identity pool              | `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/         POOL_ID        /*`                                                                           |

For a complete list of principal identifiers, see [Principal identifiers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-identifiers) .

## Other considerations

This section describes other considerations when using Workforce Identity Federation.

### Restrict cross-organization access

Workforce identity pool principals can't directly access resources outside of the organization that they belong to. However, if a principal is given permission to [impersonate a service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/impersonating-service-accounts) within the organization, this constraint can be bypassed as service accounts aren't equally restricted.

### Workforce pools user project

Most Google Cloud APIs (resource-based APIs) charge billing and quota to the project containing the resource. Some APIs (client-based APIs) charge the project associated with the client, known as the *quota project* .

When you create a Workforce Identity Federation configuration file, you specify a *workforce pools user project* . This project identifies your application to Google APIs and serves as the default quota project for client-based APIs, unless you use the gcloud CLI to make the request. You must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission (included in the Service Usage Consumer role, ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` )) for the specified project.

For more information about the quota project, resource-based APIs, and client-based APIs, see [Quota project overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/quota-project) .

### Example: multiple workforce identity pools

This section contains an example that illustrates typical use of multiple pools.

You can create one pool for employees and another for partners. Multinational organizations might create separate pools for different divisions in their organization. Pools allow for distributed management, in which different groups can independently manage their specific pool where roles are granted only to the identities in the pool.

For example, suppose that a company named Enterprise Example Organization contracts a different company named Partner Example Organization Inc to provide Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) DevOps services. For Partner Example Organization workforce to provide the services, their workforce must be allowed to access Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and other Google Cloud resources in Enterprise Example Organization's organization. Enterprise Example organization already has a workforce identity pool called `enterprise-example-organization-employees` .

To allow Partner Example Organization to manage access to Enterprise Example Organization's resources, Enterprise Example Organization creates a separate workforce pool for Partner Example Organization workforce users so that Partner Example Organization can manage it. Enterprise Example Organization provides the workforce pool to a Partner Example Organization administrator. Partner Example Organization's administrator uses their own IdP to grant access to their workforce.

To do this, Enterprise Example Organization's Admin performs the following tasks:

1.  Create an identity such as `partner-organization-admin@example.com` for the Partner Example Organization administrator in Enterprise Example Organization's IdP, which is already configured in the pool called `enterprise-example-organization-employees` .

2.  Create a new workforce pool called `example-organization-partner` .

3.  Create the following allow policy for the `example-organization-partner` pool:
    
        {
          "bindings": [
            {
              "role": "roles/iam.workforcePoolEditor",
              "members": [
                "principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/enterprise-example-organization-employees/subject/partner-organization-admin@example.com"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }

4.  Grant roles for the `example-organization-partner` pool on the resources they need access to in Enterprise Example Organization's organization.

Partner Example Organization's administrator can now configure the `example-organization-partner` pool to connect with their IdP. They can then allow Partner Example Organization workforce to sign in with Partner Example Organization's IdP credentials. After they sign in, Partner Example Organization workforce users can access Google Cloud resources, constrained by policies that are defined by Enterprise Example Organization.

### Security groups best practices

In large enterprises, IT administrators often create security groups as part of a best-practices access-control model. Security groups govern access to internal resources. Further, companies often create additional groups for employees and other groups for partners to extend this access-control model to cloud resources. This can result in proliferation of deeply nested groups that can become very difficult to manage.

Your organization might also have policies that limit the number of groups that you can create so as to keep the user directory hierarchy reasonably flat. A better solution to prevent misconfiguration of IAM policies and limit growth of groups is to use multiple pools to create a broader separation of users from different organizational units and business units, and partner organizations. You can then reference these pools and groups contained within these pools to define IAM policies (see examples in the Configuring IAM step).

### VPC Service Controls limitations

Workforce Identity Federation administrative features, including workforce pool configuration APIs don't support VPC Service Controls. However, Google Cloud products that support both [Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/federated-identity-supported-services) and [VPC Service Controls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/supported-products) operate as documented and are subject to VPC Service Controls policy checks. Additionally, you can use [third-party identities](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/configure-identity-groups) such as workforce pool users and workload identities in the ingress or egress rules of VPC Service Controls.

For Security Token Service API requests where the audience is a [Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/federated-identity-supported-services) pool (which is an organization-level resource), you must configure egress rules. This is necessary because VPC Service Controls does not support adding organization-level resources directly to perimeters. The following egress rules allow requests originating from the perimeter to reach the Workforce STS APIs that interact with organization-level Workforce pools:

    - egressTo:
        operations:
          - serviceName: 'sts.googleapis.com'
            methodSelectors:
              - method: '*'
        resources:
          - '*'
      egressFrom:
        identityType: ANY_IDENTITY

### Workforce Identity Federation and Essential Contacts

To receive important information about changes to your organization or Google Cloud products, you must provide [Essential Contacts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/managing-notification-contacts) when using Workforce Identity Federation. Cloud Identity users can be contacted through their Cloud Identity email address, but Workforce Identity Federation users are contacted using Essential Contacts.

When you use the Google Cloud console to create or manage workforce identity pools, you will see a banner that asks you to configure an essential contact with the **Legal** and **Suspension** category. Alternatively, you can define a contact in the **All** category if you don't have separate contacts. Supplying the contacts will remove the banner.
