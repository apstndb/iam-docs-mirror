This guide shows you how to manage OAuth-based application integrations with Google Cloud.

> **Important:** OAuth application integration works only with Identity-Aware Proxy.

At a high level, to integrate an OAuth-based application, you do the following:

1.  [Create an OAuth client](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-manage-oauth-app#create) .
2.  [Create an OAuth client credential](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-manage-oauth-app#create-credential) .
3.  In the OAuth client credential, obtain the client secret. To learn about risks associated with storing and accessing the client secret and strategies that can help mitigate them, see [OAuth client and credential security risks and mitigations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-oauth-app#security) .

After you have completed these steps, the OAuth-based application can access Google Cloud products and data.

## Before you begin

1.  You must have a Google Cloud organization set up.

2.  [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. After installation, [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
    
        gcloud init
    
    If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    > **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update` .

3.  You must have set up a workforce identity pool and provider in the organization in which you will register the OAuth application. Learn how to set up workforce identity federation for [Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-sign-in-microsoft-entra-id) , [Okta](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-sign-in-okta) , and [other OIDC and SAML 2.0 providers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation) .

## Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to register an OAuth application for your organization, ask your administrator to grant you the [IAM OAuth Client Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.oauthClientAdmin) ( `roles/iam.oauthClientAdmin` ) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Manage OAuth clients

This section shows you how to manage OAuth clients.

### Create an OAuth client

To create an OAuth client, do the following:

### gcloud

    gcloud iam oauth-clients create APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID \
        --project=PROJECT_ID \
        --location=global \
        --client-type="CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT" \
        --display-name="My OAuth application" \
        --description="An application registration for MyApp" \
        --allowed-scopes="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" \
        --allowed-redirect-uris="REDIRECT_URI" \
        --allowed-grant-types="authorization_code_grant"

Replace the following:

  - `  APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID  ` : a client ID to represent this OAuth client.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the ID of the project where you created your workforce identity pool and provider. The project must be created in the organization where your workforce pool and provider were created.
  - `  REDIRECT_URI  ` : the redirect URI for the OAuth application—for example, `https://myapp.com/signin-callback` .

### REST

    curl -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Goog-User-Project: PROJECT_ID" \
      -d "{ \
            'allowedGrantTypes': ['AUTHORIZATION_CODE_GRANT'], \
            'allowedRedirectUris': ['REDIRECT_URI'], \
            'allowedScopes': ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'], \
            'clientType': 'CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT', \
            'description': 'My OAuth client description', \
            'disabled': false, \
            'displayName': 'My OAuth client'}" \
      https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/oauthClients\?oauthClientId\=APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the ID of the project where you created your workforce identity pool and provider. The project must be created in the organization where your workforce pool and provider were created.
  - `  REDIRECT_URI  ` : the redirect URI for the OAuth application—for example, `https://myapp.com/signin-callback` .
  - `  APP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID  ` : a client ID to represent this OAuth client.

After you register the application, you [create the OAuth client credential](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-manage-oauth-app#create-credential) and obtain the secret that the OAuth application uses to access Google Cloud.

### List OAuth clients

To list registered OAuth clients, run the following command:
