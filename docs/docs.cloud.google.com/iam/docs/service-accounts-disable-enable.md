This page explains how to disable and enable service accounts using the Identity and Access Management (IAM) API, the Google Cloud console, and the gcloud CLI.

## Before you begin

  - Enable the IAM API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

  - Set up authentication.
    
    Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
    
    ### Console
    
    When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
    
    ### gcloud
    
    In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
    
    ### C\#
    
    To use the .NET samples on this page in a local development environment, install and initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with your user credentials.
    
    1.  [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
    
    2.  If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    3.  If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account:
        
            gcloud auth application-default login
        
        You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
        
        If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider (IdP), confirm that you have [signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

  - Understand [IAM service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview)

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to manage service accounts, ask your administrator to grant you the [Service Account Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountAdmin) ( `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin` ) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

IAM basic roles also contain permissions to manage service accounts. You should not grant basic roles in a production environment, but you can grant them in a development or test environment.

## Disable a service account

Similar to deleting a service account, when you disable a service account, applications will no longer have access to Google Cloud resources through that service account. If you disable the default App Engine and Compute Engine service accounts, the instances will no longer have access to resources in the project. If you attempt to disable an already disabled service account, it will have no effect.

Unlike deleting a service account, disabled service accounts can easily be re-enabled as necessary. We recommend disabling a service account before deleting it to make sure no critical applications are using the service account. For more information, see [Disable unused service accounts before deleting them](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#disable-before-delete) .

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Service accounts** page.

2.  Select a project.

3.  Click the name of the service account that you want to disable.

4.  Under **Service account status** , click **Disable service account** , then click **Disable** to confirm the change.

### gcloud

1.  In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.

2.  Execute the `  gcloud iam service-accounts disable  ` command to disable a service account.
    
    Command:
    
        gcloud iam service-accounts disable SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    
    Output:
    
        Disabled service account SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

### REST

The `  serviceAccounts.disable  ` method immediately disables a service account.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .
  - `  SA_ID  ` : The ID of your service account. This can either be the service account's email address in the form `  SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com ` , or the service account's unique numeric ID.

HTTP method and URL:

    POST https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID:disable

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    curl -X POST \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
         -d "" \
         "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID:disable"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method POST `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Uri "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID:disable" | Select-Object -Expand Content

#### APIs Explorer (browser)

Open the [method reference page](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts/disable) . The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page. You can interact with this tool to send requests. Complete any required fields and click **Execute** .

If successful, the response body will be empty.

## Enable a service account

After enabling a disabled service account, applications will regain access to Google Cloud resources through that service account.

You can enable a disabled service account whenever you need to. If you attempt to enable an already enabled service account, it will have no effect.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Service accounts** page.

2.  Select a project.

3.  Click the name of the service account that you want to enable.

4.  Under **Service account status** , click **Enable service account** , then click **Enable** to confirm the change.

### gcloud

1.  In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.

2.  Execute the `  gcloud iam service-accounts enable  ` command to enable a service account.
    
    Command:
    
        gcloud iam service-accounts enable SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    
    Output:
    
        Enabled service account SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

### REST

The `  serviceAccounts.enable  ` method enables a previously disabled service account.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .
  - `  SA_ID  ` : The ID of your service account. This can either be the service account's email address in the form `  SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com ` , or the service account's unique numeric ID.

HTTP method and URL:

    POST https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID:enable

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    curl -X POST \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
         -d "" \
         "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID:enable"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method POST `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Uri "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID:enable" | Select-Object -Expand Content

#### APIs Explorer (browser)

Open the [method reference page](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts/enable) . The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page. You can interact with this tool to send requests. Complete any required fields and click **Execute** .

If successful, the response body will be empty.
