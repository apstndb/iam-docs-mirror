description: Learn how to view and manage entitlements
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

After you have [created an entitlement](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-create-entitlements) , you can view, update, or delete it. Changes to an entitlement's requesters and approvers [might take a few minutes to propagate](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-change-propagation) .

## Before you begin

To get the permissions that you need to manage entitlements, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the organization, folder, or project:

  - To manage entitlements for an organization:
      - [Privileged Access Manager Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/privilegedaccessmanager#privilegedaccessmanager.admin) ( `roles/privilegedaccessmanager.admin` )
      - [Security Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.securityAdmin) ( `roles/iam.securityAdmin` )
  - To manage for a folder:
      - [Privileged Access Manager Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/privilegedaccessmanager#privilegedaccessmanager.admin) ( `roles/privilegedaccessmanager.admin` )
      - [Folder IAM Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/resourcemanager#resourcemanager.folderAdmin) ( `roles/resourcemanager.folderAdmin` )
  - To manage entitlements for a project:
      - [Privileged Access Manager Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/privilegedaccessmanager#privilegedaccessmanager.admin) ( `roles/privilegedaccessmanager.admin` )
      - [Project IAM Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/resourcemanager#resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin) ( `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin` )
  - To view audit logs: Logs Viewer ( `roles/logs.viewer` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to manage entitlements. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to manage entitlements:

  - To manage entitlements for an organization:
      - `resourcemanager.organizations.get`
      - `resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.create`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.delete`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.list`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.setIamPolicy`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.operations.delete`

      - `privilegedaccessmanager.operations.list`
  - To view entitlements for a folder:
      - `resourcemanager.folders.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.list`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.operations.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.operations.list`
  - To manage entitlements for a project:
      - `resourcemanager.projects.get`
      - `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.create`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.delete`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.list`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.setIamPolicy`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.operations.delete`

      - `resourcemanager.projects.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.entitlements.list`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.operations.get`
      - `privilegedaccessmanager.operations.list`
  - To view audit logs: `logging.logEntries.list`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## View, update, and delete entitlements using the Google Cloud console

1.  Go to the **Privileged Access Manager** page.

2.  Select the organization, folder, or project you want to manage entitlements in.

3.  In the **Entitlements** tab, click the **Entitlements for all users** tab. Here you can find the available entitlements, the roles they grant, and their valid requesters and approvers.

4.  In the table, click more\_vert **More options** in the same row as an entitlement you want to inspect.
    
      - To view the entitlement details, click **View entitlement details** .
    
      - To view grants associated with the entitlement, click **View associated grants** .
    
      - To revoke all active grants for the entitlement, click **Revoke all grants** .
    
      - To delete the entitlement, click **Delete entitlement** . You can't delete an entitlement with active grants. You must revoke the grants first.

5.  To update an entitlement, click edit **Edit entitlement** in the same row as the entitlement you want to update.
    
    Keep the following things in mind when updating an entitlement:
    
      - The updated entitlement configuration only applies to grants requested after the update is made. Approver changes, however, also apply to existing grant requests that haven't yet been approved or denied.
    
      - To make changes to an entitlement's approval workflow that require a second level of approval, or more than one approval in any level, you must have the Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier activated. This feature is available in [preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .
    
      - You can make the following structural changes to an entitlement's approval workflow only if no grants for that entitlement are awaiting approval:
        
          - Adding or removing an approval level.
          - Changing the number of required approvals for any level.
        
        This feature is available in [preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .
    
      - You can change the list of approvers in any approval level, even if there are grants awaiting approval.

## View entitlements programmatically

To view entitlements programmatically, you can search, list, get, and export them.

### List entitlements

### Export entitlements using the gcloud CLI

The `gcloud alpha pam entitlements export` command exports a specific entitlement to a YAML file.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement to export.
  - `  FILENAME  ` : The filename to export the entitlement contents to.
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud alpha pam entitlements export \
        ENTITLEMENT_ID \
        --destination=FILENAME.yaml \
        --location=global \
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud alpha pam entitlements export `
        ENTITLEMENT_ID `
        --destination=FILENAME.yaml `
        --location=global `
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud alpha pam entitlements export ^
        ENTITLEMENT_ID ^
        --destination=FILENAME.yaml ^
        --location=global ^
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

You should receive a response similar to the following:

    Exported [projects/my-project/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID] to 'FILENAME.yaml'.

## Update entitlements programmatically

Keep the following things in mind when updating an entitlement:

  - The updated entitlement configuration only applies to grants requested after the update is made. Approver changes, however, also apply to existing grant requests that haven't yet been approved or denied.

  - To make changes to an entitlement's approval workflow that require a second level of approval, or more than one approval in any level, you must have the Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier activated. This feature is available in [preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

  - You can make the following structural changes to an entitlement's approval workflow only if no grants for that entitlement are awaiting approval:
    
      - Adding or removing an approval level.
      - Changing the number of required approvals for any level.
    
    This feature is available in [preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

  - You can change the list of approvers in any approval level, even if there are grants awaiting approval.

### gcloud

The `gcloud alpha pam entitlements update` command updates a specific entitlement.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement to update.
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
