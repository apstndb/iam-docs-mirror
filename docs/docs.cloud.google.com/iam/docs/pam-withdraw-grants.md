### gcloud

The `gcloud alpha pam grants withdraw` command withdraws a grant.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  GRANT_ID  ` : The ID of the grant you want to withdraw. You can retrieve the ID by [viewing grants](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-view-grants) .
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud alpha pam grants withdraw \
         GRANT_ID \
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID \
        --location=global \
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud alpha pam grants withdraw `
         GRANT_ID `
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID `
        --location=global `
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud alpha pam grants withdraw ^
         GRANT_ID ^
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID ^
        --location=global ^
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

You should receive a response similar to the following:

    Parsed [grant] resource: RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID
    Grant withdrawal initiated. The operation will complete in some time.
    To track its status, run:
    `gcloud alpha pam operations wait RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID/locations/global/operations/OPERATION_ID`
    Note that the wait command requires you to have the `privilegedaccessmanager.operations.get` permission on the resource.
    metadata:
      apiVersion: v1
      createTime: '2024-08-20T10:10:10.101010101Z'
      target: RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID
    name: RESOURCE_TYPE/RESOURCE_ID/locations/global/operations/OPERATION_ID
