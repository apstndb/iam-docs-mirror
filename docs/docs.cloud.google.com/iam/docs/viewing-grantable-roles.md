Before you grant an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to a user for a resource, you might want to know what roles are available to grant on a particular resource.

## Before you begin

  - Enable the IAM API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

  - Set up authentication.
    
    Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
    
    ### Console
    
    When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
    
    ### gcloud
    
    In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
    
    ### C\#
    
    To use the .NET samples on this page in a local development environment, install and initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with your user credentials.
    
    1.  [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
    
    2.  If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    3.  If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account:
        
            gcloud auth application-default login
        
        You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
        
        If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider (IdP), confirm that you have [signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to list grantable roles, ask your administrator to grant you the [Security Reviewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.securityReviewer) ( `roles/iam.securityReviewer` ) IAM role on the resource that you want to list grantable roles for. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This role contains the `getIamPolicy` permissions for all resource types. To list grantable roles, you need the `getIamPolicy` permission for the resource that you want to list grantable roles for—for example, to list grantable roles for a project, you need the `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy` permission.

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Understanding what roles are grantable

A role is grantable on or above a resource if it contains any permissions for that resource type. For example, the `storage.admin` role grants permissions to the `storage.buckets.get` and `storage.objects.get` APIs, so it is grantable on the *Storage Buckets* and *Storage Objects* resource types.

Roles can also be granted "above" the resource types that their permissions are defined for. In other words, roles for lower-level resources can be granted on a resource that is higher in the Google Cloud resource hierarchy. For example, the `storage.admin` role can also be granted at the project or organization levels, in addition to *Storage Buckets* .

Permissions granted by a role only affect resources at the specified level or below; they do not affect higher-level or peer resources. Additionally, when a role is granted on a resource, only permissions applicable to the given resource are granted, regardless of the role's name, description, or other permissions it contains. For example, assigning the role `resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` (which grants the permission `resourcemanager.projects.list` ) to a user on the project level only grants them permissions for that specific project. It will **not** allow them to list or administer all projects in the organization. Similarly, assigning the `compute.admin` role on a specific Compute Engine instance only grants permissions for that instance, not others in the project.

## Listing grantable roles

You can list grantable roles using the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, the IAM API, or the IAM client libraries.

The Google Cloud console always lists all grantable roles for the resource you're viewing. The Google Cloud CLI, IAM API, and client libraries only list grantable roles for [enabled APIs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/enable-disable#enabling) .

### Console

To view grantable roles for a project, folder, or organization, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page.

2.  Click **Select a project** at the top of the page.

3.  Select the project, folder, or organization for which you want to view grantable roles.

4.  Click person\_add **Grant access** .

5.  Click **Select a role** . This menu displays all the roles, including any custom roles, that you can grant on this resource.

To view grantable roles for other resource types, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the page listing the resource for which you want to view grantable roles.
    
    For example, to manage access to a Compute Engine instance, go to the **VM instances** page.

2.  Select the checkbox next to the resource for which you want to view grantable roles.

3.  Ensure that the info panel is visible. If it is not visible, click **Show info panel** .

4.  Click person\_add **Add principal** .

5.  Click **Select a role** . This menu displays all the roles, including any custom roles, that you can grant on this resource.

### gcloud

Use the [`gcloud iam list-grantable-roles`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/list-grantable-roles) command to return a list of all roles that can be applied to a given resource.

    gcloud iam list-grantable-roles full-resource-name

Depending on the desired resource, a large number of roles may be returned. To limit the results, you can specify a [filter expression](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/filters) .

The output will look something like:

    description: Full control of all Compute Engine resources.
    name: roles/compute.admin
    title: Compute Admin
    ---
    description: Full control of Compute Engine instance resources.
    name: roles/compute.instanceAdmin
    title: Compute Instance Admin

### REST

The `  roles.queryGrantableRoles  ` method returns a list of all roles grantable on a resource.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  FULL_RESOURCE_NAME  ` : A URI consisting of the service name and the path to the resource. For examples, see [Full resource names](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names) .

HTTP method and URL:

    POST https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/roles:queryGrantableRoles

Request JSON body:

    {
      "fullResourceName": "FULL_RESOURCE_NAME"
    }

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Save the request body in a file named `request.json` , and execute the following command:

    curl -X POST \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
         -d @request.json \
         "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/roles:queryGrantableRoles"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Save the request body in a file named `request.json` , and execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method POST `
        -Headers $headers `
        -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" `
        -InFile request.json `
        -Uri "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/roles:queryGrantableRoles" | Select-Object -Expand Content

#### APIs Explorer (browser)

Copy the request body and open the [method reference page](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/roles/queryGrantableRoles) . The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page. You can interact with this tool to send requests. Paste the request body in this tool, complete any other required fields, and click **Execute** .

You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:

    {
      "roles": [
        {
          "name": "roles/compute.admin",
          "title": "Compute Admin",
          "description": "Full control of all Compute Engine resources."
        },
        {
          "name": "roles/compute.instanceAdmin",
          "title": "Compute Instance Admin (beta)",
          "description": "Full control of Compute Engine instance resources."
        }
      ]
    }

In the examples above, the *full resource name* is a scheme-less URI consisting of a DNS-compatible API service name and a resource path.

For example, to return all roles grantable on a project, use:

    //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/project-id

Lower-level resources have a more detailed fully qualified name. For example, use the following to return all roles grantable on a Compute Engine instance:

    //compute.googleapis.com/projects/project-id/zones/zone-name/instances/instance-id
