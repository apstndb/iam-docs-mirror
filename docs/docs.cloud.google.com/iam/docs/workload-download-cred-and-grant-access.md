This page describes how to configure your workloads to access Google Cloud resources by using Workload Identity Federation and either direct resource access or [service account impersonation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds#allow_the_external_workload_to_impersonate_the_service_account) .

You can find end-to-end, use case-specific instructions in configuration guides for [AWS and Azure](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds) , [Active Directory](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-active-directory) , [GitHub, GitLab, and other deployment pipelines](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-deployment-pipelines) , and [Kubernetes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-kubernetes) .

## Allow your external workload to access Google Cloud resources

To provide your workload with access to Google Cloud resources, we recommend that you grant direct resource access to the principal. In this case, the principal is the federated user. Some Google Cloud products have [Google Cloud API limitations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/federated-identity-supported-services) . If your workload calls an API endpoint that has a limitation, you can instead use service account impersonation. In this case, the principal is the Google Cloud service account, which acts as the identity. You grant access to the service account on the resource.

### Direct resource access

You can grant access to a federated identity directly on resources by using the Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI.

### Console

To use the Google Cloud console to grant IAM roles directly on a resource, you must go to the resource's page, and then grant the role. The following example shows you how to go to the Cloud Storage page and grant the role Storage Object Viewer ( `roles/storage.objectViewer` ) to a federated identity directly on a Cloud Storage bucket.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud Storage **Buckets** page.  

2.  In the list of buckets, click the name of the bucket for which you want to grant the role.

3.  Select the **Permissions** tab near the top of the page.

4.  Click the *add\_box* **Grant access** button.
    
    The **Add principals** dialog appears.

5.  In the **New principals** field, enter one or more identities that need access to your bucket.
    
    ### By subject
    
        principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/subject/SUBJECT
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the project number
      - `  POOL_ID  ` : the workload pool ID
      - `  SUBJECT  ` : the individual subject mapped from your IdP—for example, `administrator@example.com`
    
    ### By group
    
        principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/group/GROUP
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the project number
      - `  WORKLOAD_POOL_ID  ` : the workload pool ID
      - `  GROUP  ` : the group mapped from your IdP—for example: `administrator-group@example.com`
    
    ### By attribute
    
        principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/attribute.ATTRIBUTE_NAME/ATTRIBUTE_VALUE
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the project number
      - `  WORKLOAD_POOL_ID  ` : the workload pool ID
      - `  ATTRIBUTE_NAME  ` : one of the attributes that was mapped from your IdP
      - `  ATTRIBUTE_VALUE  ` : the value of the attribute

6.  Select a role (or roles) from the **Select a role** drop-down menu. The roles you select appear in the pane with a short description of the permissions they grant.

7.  Click **Save** .

### gcloud

To use the gcloud CLI to grant IAM roles on a resource in a project, do the following:

1.  Obtain the project number of the project in which the resource is defined.
    
        gcloud projects describe $(gcloud config get-value core/project) --format=value\(projectNumber\)

2.  Grant access to the resource.
    
    To use the gcloud CLI to grant the role Storage Object Viewer ( `roles/storage.objectViewer` ) to external identities that meet certain criteria, run the following command.
    
    ### By subject
    
        gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding BUCKET_ID \
            --role=roles/storage.objectViewer \
            --member="principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/subject/SUBJECT"
    
    ### By group
    
        gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding BUCKET_ID \
            --role=roles/storage.objectViewer \
            --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/group/GROUP"
    
    ### By attribute
    
        gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding BUCKET_ID \
            --role=roles/storage.objectViewer \
            --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/attribute.ATTRIBUTE_NAME/ATTRIBUTE_VALUE"
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  BUCKET_ID  ` : the bucket on which to grant access
      - `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the [project number](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) . of the project that contains the workload identity pool
      - `  POOL_ID  ` : the pool ID of the workload identity pool
      - `  SUBJECT  ` : the expected value for the attribute that [you've mapped](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-download-cred-and-grant-access#mappings-and-conditions) to `google.subject`
      - `  GROUP  ` : the expected value for the attribute that [you've mapped](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-download-cred-and-grant-access#mappings-and-conditions) to `google.groups`
      - `  ATTRIBUTE_NAME  ` : the name of a custom attribute in [your attribute mapping](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-download-cred-and-grant-access#mappings-and-conditions)
      - `  ATTRIBUTE_VALUE  ` : the value of the custom attribute in your attribute mapping
    
    You can grant roles on any Google Cloud resource that supports IAM allow policies.
    
    > **Note:** You must use the project number, not the project ID, in the member identifier.

### Service account impersonation

1.  To create a service account for the external workload, do the following:
    
    1.  Enable the IAM, Security Token Service, and Service Account Credentials APIs.
        
        **Roles required to enable APIs**
        
        To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    2.  [Create a service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) that represents the workload. We recommend that you [use a dedicated service account for each workload](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-for-using-workload-identity-federation#use-dedicated-service-accounts) . The service account doesn't need to be in the same project as the workload identity pool, but you must refer to the project that contains the service account.
    
    3.  [Grant the service account access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) to resources that you want external identities to access.

2.  To let the federated identity impersonate the service account, do the following:

### Console

To use the Google Cloud console to grant IAM roles to a federated identity with service account, do the following:

### Service Account in the same project

1.  To grant access using service account impersonation for a service account in the same project, do the following:
    
    1.  Go to the **Workload Identity Pools** page.
    
    2.  Select **Grant access** .
    
    3.  In the **Grant access to service account** dialog, select **Grant access using Service Account impersonation** .
    
    4.  In the **Service accounts** list, select the service account for the external identities to impersonate, and do the following:
    
    5.  To choose which identities in the pool can impersonate the service account, perform one of the following actions:
        
          - To allow only specific identities of the workload identity pool to impersonate the service account, select **Only identities matching the filter** .
        
          - In the **Attribute name** list, select the attribute that you want to filter on.
        
          - In the **Attribute value** field, enter the expected value of the attribute; for example, if you use an attribute mapping `google.subject=assertion.sub` , set **Attribute** name to `subject` and **Attribute value** to the value of the `sub` claim in tokens that are issued by your external identity provider.
    
    6.  To save the configuration, click **Save** and then **Dismiss** .

### Service account in a different project

> **Note:** Service accounts from different projects won't appear in the "CONNECTED SERVICE ACCOUNTS" section of your **Workload Identity Pool** .

1.  To grant access using service account impersonation for a service account in a different project, do the following:
    
    1.  Go to the **Service Accounts** page.
    
    2.  Select the service account that you want to impersonate.
    
    3.  Click **Manage access** .
    
    4.  Click **Add principal** .
    
    5.  In the **New principal** field, enter one of the following [principal identifiers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation#principal-types) for the identities in your pool that will impersonate the service account.
        
        ### By subject
        
            principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/subject/SUBJECT
        
        Replace the following:
        
          - `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the project number
          - `  POOL_ID  ` : the workload pool ID
          - `  SUBJECT  ` : the individual subject mapped from your IdP—for example, `administrator@example.com`
        
        ### By group
        
            principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/group/GROUP
        
        Replace the following:
        
          - `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the project number
          - `  WORKLOAD_POOL_ID  ` : the workload pool ID
          - `  GROUP  ` : the group mapped from your IdP—for example: `administrator-group@example.com`
        
        ### By attribute
        
            principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/attribute.ATTRIBUTE_NAME/ATTRIBUTE_VALUE
        
        Replace the following:
        
          - `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the project number
          - `  WORKLOAD_POOL_ID  ` : the workload pool ID
          - `  ATTRIBUTE_NAME  ` : one of the attributes that was mapped from your IdP
          - `  ATTRIBUTE_VALUE  ` : the value of the attribute
        
        ### By pool
        
            principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/*
        
        Replace the following:
        
          - `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the project number
          - `  WORKLOAD_POOL_ID  ` : the workload pool ID
    
    6.  In **Select a role** , select the Workload Identity User role ( `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` ).
    
    7.  To save the configuration, click **Save** .

### gcloud

To grant the Workload Identity User role ( `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` ) to a federated principal or principal set, run the following command. To learn more about Workload Identity Federation principal identifiers, see [Principal types](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation#principal-types) .
