title: View grants in Privileged Access Manager
description: Use Privileged Access Manager (PAM) to manage just-in-time temporary privilege elevation for select principals, and view audit logs to find out who had access to what and when.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

You can view a grant's status and history, or revoke a grant for other principals if it's active. Grant history is available for 30 days after a grant has ended.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have [enabled Privileged Access Manager and set up permissions for it](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-permissions-and-setup) .

## View grants using the Google Cloud console

To view a grant, complete the following instructions:

1.  Go to the **Privileged Access Manager** page.

2.  Select the organization, folder, or project you want to view grants in.

3.  Click the **Grants** tab, followed by the **Grants for all users** tab. This tab contains all grants, the requesters for those grants, and the grant status. Grants can have the following statuses:
    
    | Status                                    | Description                                                                                                                  |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Activating                                | The grant is in the process of being activated.                                                                              |
    | Activation failed                         | Privileged Access Manager couldn't grant the roles due to a non-retriable error.                                             |
    | Active                                    | The grant is active and the principal has access to the resources permitted by the roles.                                    |
    | Approval awaited                          | The grant request is waiting on a decision from an approver.                                                                 |
    | Denied                                    | The grant request has been denied by an approver.                                                                            |
    | Ended                                     | The grant has ended and the roles have been removed from the principal.                                                      |
    | Expired                                   | The grant request has expired, as approval wasn't given within 24 hours or by the scheduled activation time.                 |
    | Revoked                                   | The grant is revoked, and the principal no longer has access to the resources permitted by the roles.                        |
    | Revoking                                  | The grant is in the process of being revoked.                                                                                |
    | Scheduled for `           DATE          ` | The grant is scheduled and activates at the chosen activation time, provided all approvals (if needed) are received by then. |
    | Withdrawing                               | The grant is in the process of being withdrawn.                                                                              |
    | Withdrawn                                 | The grant is withdrawn, and the principal no longer has access to the resources permitted by the roles.                      |
    

    **Status Labels**
    
    In addition to these statuses, grants can have the following status labels displayed next to their status, which indicate special conditions:
    
    ***Modified through IAM***
    
    The IAM policy bindings associated with this grant have been modified directly through IAM. For details on modified bindings, see the [IAM page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin) in the Google Cloud console. When a modified grant is revoked or ends, Privileged Access Manager only removes the bindings it has created that haven't been modified through IAM.
    
    Modifying the IAM condition title or expression, or removing the requester's access to the granted role is treated as an external modification. Adding or modifying the IAM condition description is not considered an external modification.
    
    Privileged Access Manager checks for external modifications to grants every 5 minutes. It can take up to 5 minutes to reflect these changes. Transient changes made and reverted within this 5-minute window might not be detected by Privileged Access Manager.
    
    > **Note:** Each binding created by Privileged Access Manager has a time-based condition that expires with the grant duration. As long as the time condition is not altered, the requester's privileged access will end when the grant expires.

4.  In the table, click more\_vert **More options** in the same row as an entitlement you want to inspect.
    
      - To view the grant details including its history, click **View details** . You can also revoke a grant from this panel.
    
      - To revoke an active grant, click **Revoke grant** .

You can also view temporarily granted roles on the [IAM page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin) in the Google Cloud console. On the **View by principals** tab, temporarily granted roles have a condition of **Created by: PAM** .

## View grants programmatically

To view grants programmatically, you can search, list, and get them.

### Search grants

### gcloud

The `gcloud alpha pam grants search` command searches for a grant you have created, can approve or deny, or have already approved or denied. This method doesn't require specific Privileged Access Manager permissions to use.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to. You can retrieve the ID by [viewing entitlements](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-view-update-delete-entitlements) .

  - `  CALLER_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE  ` : Use one of the following values:
    
      - `had-created` : Returns grants the caller has created.
      - `had-approved` : Returns grants the caller has approved or denied.
      - `can-approve` : Returns grants the caller can approve or deny.

  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .

  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud alpha pam grants search \
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID \
        --caller-relationship=CALLER_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE \
        --location=global \
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud alpha pam grants search `
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID `
        --caller-relationship=CALLER_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE `
        --location=global `
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud alpha pam grants search ^

### Get grants

### gcloud

The `gcloud alpha pam grants describe` command retrieves a specific grant.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  GRANT_ID  ` : The ID of the grant you want the details for.
  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud alpha pam grants describe \
        GRANT_ID \
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID \
        --location=global \
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud alpha pam grants describe `
        GRANT_ID `
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID `
        --location=global `
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud alpha pam grants describe ^
        GRANT_ID ^
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID ^
        --location=global ^
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

You should receive a response similar to the following:

### REST

The Privileged Access Manager API's `getGrant` method retrieves a specific grant.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  SCOPE  ` : The organization, folder, or project that the entitlement is in, in the format of ` organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID  ` , ` folders/ FOLDER_ID  ` , or ` projects/ PROJECT_ID  ` . Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .
  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  GRANT_ID  ` : The ID of the grant you want the details for.

HTTP method and URL:

    GET https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1beta/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    curl -X GET \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         "https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1beta/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method GET `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Uri "https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1beta/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID" | Select-Object -Expand Content
