This page explains how to manage your existing [workload identity pools](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation) and their identity providers.

You can manage pools and providers using the Google Cloud console, the [Google Cloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) , or the [REST API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest) .

## Before you begin

Create a workload identity pool. For instructions, see the [Workload Identity Federation configuration guides](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation#providers) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to manage workload identity pools and providers, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project:

  - To view pools and providers: [IAM Workload Identity Pool Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.workloadIdentityPoolViewer) ( `roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolViewer` )
  - To view, create, update, and delete pools and providers: [IAM Workload Identity Pool Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin) ( `roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to manage workload identity pools and providers. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to manage workload identity pools and providers:

  - To view workload identity pools and providers:
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.get`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.list`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.get`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.list`
  - To create, update, and delete pools and providers:
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.create`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.delete`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.undelete`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.update`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.create`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.delete`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.undelete`
      - `iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.update`

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

Execute the [`gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workload-identity-pools/create) command.

### REST

Call [`projects.locations.workloadIdentityPools.create()`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.workloadIdentityPools/create) .

### List pools

To list all the workload identity pools in a project, do the following:

### Console

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Workload Identity Pools** page.

### Get a pool

To get details for a specific workload identity pool, do the following:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Workload Identity Pools** page.

2.  Find the workload identity pool that you want to view, then click its edit **Edit** icon. The Google Cloud console shows details about the workload identity pool.

### gcloud

Execute the [`gcloud iam workload-identity-pools describe`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workload-identity-pools/describe) command.

### REST

Call [`projects.locations.workloadIdentityPools.get()`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.workloadIdentityPools/get) .

### Update a pool

You can enable or disable a workload identity pool. You can also change its display name or description.

To update an existing workload identity pool, do the following:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Workload Identity Pools** page.

2.  Find the workload identity pool that you want to edit.

3.  Click the workload identity pool's **Display name** .

4.  To edit the workload identity pool's display name, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Pool details** page, next to the display name, click the edit **Edit** icon.
    
    2.  In the **Edit pool display name** dialog that appears, update the display name.

### Delete a pool

When you delete a workload identity pool, you also delete its workload identity pool providers. As a result, the identities in the pool lose access to Google Cloud resources.

> **Caution:** Before you delete a workload identity pool, consider [disabling the pool](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workload-identity-pools-providers#update-pool) or [disabling its identity providers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workload-identity-pools-providers#update-provider) . If one of your workloads loses access to Google Cloud resources as a result, you can re-enable the pool and its providers at any time. If your workloads don't lose access, then it is safe to delete the pool.

You can [undelete a pool](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workload-identity-pools-providers#undelete-pool) for up to 30 days after you delete it. After 30 days, the deletion is permanent. Until a pool is permanently deleted, you cannot reuse its name when creating a new workload identity pool.

To delete a workload identity pool and its identity providers, do the following:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Workload Identity Pools** page.

2.  Find the workload identity pool that you want to delete, then click its edit **Edit** icon.

3.  Click delete **Delete pool** , then click **Delete** . The workload identity pool and its identity providers are deleted.

### gcloud

Execute the [`gcloud iam workload-identity-pools delete`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workload-identity-pools/delete) command.

### REST

## Manage workload identity pool providers

This section shows you how to manage workload identity pool providers.

### Create a provider

To create a workload identity pool provider in an existing workload identity pool, do the following:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Workload Identity Pools** page.

2.  Find the workload identity pool that you want to add a provider to, then click its edit **Edit** icon.

3.  Click add\_box **Add provider** .

4.  Select the type of provider to create:
    
      - **AWS** : An Amazon Web Services (AWS) identity provider.
      - **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** : An OIDC-compatible identity provider. This includes Microsoft Azure.

5.  Enter a name for the provider.
    
    The Google Cloud console uses the name to create a provider ID. To change the provider ID, click **Edit** . You cannot change the provider ID later.

6.  Complete the remaining fields for your provider:
    
      - **AWS** : Enter your AWS account ID.
      - **OIDC** : Enter the issuer URL. For Azure, the issuer URL uses the format ` https://sts.windows.net/ AZURE_TENANT_ID  ` . For other providers, consult the provider's documentation.
    
    When you are done, click **Continue** .

7.  To configure the attribute mapping, click **Edit mapping** . Attribute mapping lets you use information about external identities to grant access to a subset of those identities.
    
      - **AWS** : This step is optional. You can use the default mapping.
        
        For details, see [Identity provider settings for AWS and Azure](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds#mappings-and-conditions) .
    
      - **OIDC** : We recommend mapping `google.subject` to `assertion.sub` . Other mappings are optional.
        
        For details, see identity provider settings for [Azure](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds#mappings-and-conditions) or [other OIDC providers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-providers#mappings-and-conditions) .

8.  Optional: To provide an attribute condition, which specifies the identities that can authenticate, click **Add condition** and enter a valid Common Expression Language (CEL) expression. For details, see [Attribute conditions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation#conditions) .

9.  Click **Save** . The workload identity pool provider is created.

## Manage constraints for Workload Identity Federation

You can use [organization policy constraints](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview#constraints) to restrict how resources in your Google Cloud organization can be used.

This section describes constraints that are recommended when you use Workload Identity Federation.

### Restrict identity provider configuration

As an organization administrator, you can decide which identity providers your organization is allowed to federate with.

To manage which identity providers are allowed, enable the `constraints/iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders` list constraint in the organization policy for your organization. This constraint specifies the issuer URIs of the allowed providers. You can use the [Google Cloud console](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-policies#list_constraints) or the [Google Cloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/using-constraints#list-constraint) to enable this constraint.

> **Note:** This constraint only limits creating and updating identity providers. If an identity provider was configured before you enabled the constraint, that provider can still be used.

To only allow federation from AWS, create a single constraint with the URI `https://sts.amazonaws.com` . The following example shows how to create this constraint using the gcloud CLI:

    gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow constraints/iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders \
         https://sts.amazonaws.com --organization=ORGANIZATION_NUMBER

You can also specify which AWS account IDs have access to your Google Cloud resources. To specify the account IDs, use the `constraints/iam.workloadIdentityPoolAwsAccounts` list constraint:

    gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow constraints/iam.workloadIdentityPoolAwsAccounts \
        ACCOUNT_ID --organization=ORGANIZATION_NUMBER

To only allow federation from one OIDC provider, create a single constraint with the `issuer_uri` of the allowed provider. For example, the following only allows federation from a specific Azure tenant:

    gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow constraints/iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders \
         https://sts.windows.net/AZURE_TENANT_ID --organization=ORGANIZATION_NUMBER

Federation from a SAML identity provider is special because the public keys that are used to validate the assertion are provided when the SAML identity provider is configured. As a result, it's possible that a malicious user might try to upload a SAML metadata document with the entity ID of your organization's identity provider using a public key. Restricting federation using an entity ID in this scenario gives only an illusion of security.

To mitigate this risk, we strongly advise that you only allow a workload identity pool to be created with SAML federation in a Google Cloud project that your organization centrally manages. Then, as needed, grant external identities in that workload identity pool access to resources across your organization.

To allow federation from SAML identity providers, create a constraint allowing the special keyword `KEY_UPLOAD` .

    gcloud resource-manager org-policies allow constraints/iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders \
         KEY_UPLOAD --organization=ORGANIZATION_NUMBER

You can repeat these commands to allow federation from additional providers.

To block federation from all providers:

1.  Create a YAML file containing the following:
    
        constraint: constraints/iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders
        listPolicy:
          allValues: DENY

2.  Pass the file to the [`gcloud resource-manager org-policies set-policy`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/resource-manager/org-policies/set-policy) command:
    
        gcloud resource-manager org-policies set-policy FILE_NAME.yaml \
            --organization=ORGANIZATION_NUMBER

### Restrict service account key creation

Workload Identity Federation lets you access Google Cloud resources from outside of Google Cloud without using a service account key. If you never use service account keys to authenticate, you can help reduce risk by disabling key creation.

To disable the creation of service account keys, enforce the `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` boolean constraint in the organization policy for your organization. You can also enforce the `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload` boolean constraint, which disables uploading of public keys for service accounts.

> **Note** : If your organization was created on or after May 3, 2024, these constraints are enforced by default.

You can use the [Google Cloud console](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-policies#boolean_constraints) or the [gcloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/using-constraints#boolean-constraint) to enable these constraints. For example, the following gcloud CLI commands enable both constraints:

    gcloud resource-manager org-policies enable-enforce \
        constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation \
        --organization=ORGANIZATION_NUMBER
    gcloud resource-manager org-policies enable-enforce \
        constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload \
        --organization=ORGANIZATION_NUMBER

## Monitor Workload Identity Federation

You can use [Cloud Monitoring](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs) metrics to monitor authentication events for your workload identity pools and providers. For a list of available metrics, see [IAM metrics](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp_i_o#gcp-iam) .
