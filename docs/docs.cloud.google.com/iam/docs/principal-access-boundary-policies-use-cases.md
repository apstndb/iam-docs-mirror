The following are common situations where you might want to use Principal Access Boundary policies and examples of the policies and policy bindings that you might create in each situation. To learn how to create Principal Access Boundary policies and bind them to principal sets, see [Create and apply Principal Access Boundary policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies-create) .

## Prevent users from accessing resources outside of your organization

Because Principal Access Boundary policies are associated with principals and not with resources, you can use them to prevent principals from accessing resources that you don't own. For example, consider the following scenario:

![Principal access boundary policy preventing access to a resource](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/iam/img/pab-access-attempt-example.svg)

![Principal access boundary policy preventing access to a resource](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/iam/img/pab-access-attempt-example.svg)

  - The principal Tal ( `tal@example.com` ) is part of the Google Workspace organization `example.com` .
  - Tal is granted the Storage Admin ( `roles/storage.admin` ) role on a Cloud Storage bucket in a different organization, `cymbalgroup.com` . This role contains the `storage.objects.get` permission, which is required to view objects in the bucket.
  - There are no deny policies in `cymbalgroup.com` that prevent Tal from using the `storage.objects.get` permission.

The `example.com` administrators can't use allow and deny policies to prevent Tal from viewing objects in this external bucket. No `example.com` principals have permission to edit the bucket's allow policy, so they can't revoke Tal's role. They also don't have permission to create any deny policies in `cymbalgroup.com` , so they can't use a deny policy to prevent Tal from accessing the bucket.

However, with Principal Access Boundary policies, `example.com` administrators can prevent Tal from viewing objects in the `cymbalgroup.com` bucket, or any bucket outside of `example.com` .

To do this, the administrators can create a Principal Access Boundary policy saying that `example.com` principals are only eligible to access resources in `example.com` :

    {
      "name": "organizations/0123456789012/locations/global/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/example-org-only",
      "displayName": "Boundary for principals in example.org",
      "details": {
        "rules": [
          {
            "description": "Principals are only eligible to access resources in example.org",
            "resources": [
                "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/0123456789012"
            ],
            "effect": "ALLOW"
          }
        ],
        "enforcementVersion": "4"
      }
    }

Then, they can create a policy binding to attach this policy to all principals in the organization `example.com` :

    {
      "name": "organizations/0123456789012/locations/global/policyBindings/example-org-only-binding",
      "displayName": "Bind policy to all principals in example.com",
      "target": {
        "principalSet": "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/0123456789012"
      },
      "policyKind": "PRINCIPAL_ACCESS_BOUNDARY",
      "policy": "organizations/0123456789012/locations/global/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/example-org-only"
    }

The principals that are in `example.com` include all identities in the `example.com` domain, all workforce identity pools in `example.com` , and all service accounts and workload identity pools in any project in `example.com` .

With this policy in place, the principals in `example.com` can't use permissions that are [blocked by the Principal Access Boundary policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies#blocked-permissions) to access resources outside of `example.com` , even if they have those permissions on those resources.

In this case, the Principal Access Boundary policy uses [enforcement version `4`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pab-blocked-permissions#v4) , so it's able to block the `storage.objects.get` permission. As a result, Tal won't be able to view objects in the `cymbalgroup.com` bucket, even though they're granted the Storage Admin role on the bucket.

## Make service accounts eligible to access resources in a single project

You can also use Principal Access Boundary policies to make subsets of principals eligible to access subsets of resources in your organization.

For example, imagine that you have a project, `example-dev` , with the project number `901234567890` . You want to ensure that the service accounts in `example-dev` are only eligible to access resources in `example-dev` .

To do this, you first [create a new Principal Access Boundary policy](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies-create) that makes principals eligible to access resources in `dev-project` :

    {
      "name": "organizations/0123456789012/locations/global/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/example-dev-only",
      "displayName": "Boundary for principals in example-dev",
      "details": {
        "rules": [
          {
            "description": "Principals are only eligible to access resources in example-dev",
            "resources": [
              "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/example-dev"
            ],
            "effect": "ALLOW"
          }
        ],
        "enforcementVersion": "4"
      }
    }

This Principal Access Boundary policy uses the enforcement version `4` , meaning that it's able to block all of the [permissions supported in enforcement version `4`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pab-blocked-permissions#v4) .

After you create the Principal Access Boundary policy, you create a policy binding to bind the new policy to all principals in `example-dev` , and add a [condition](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies#conditions) so that the policy binding only applies for service accounts:

    {
      "name": "organizations/0123456789012/locations/global/policyBindings/example-dev-only-binding",
      "displayName": "Bind policy to all service accounts in example-dev",
      "target": {
        "principalSet": "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/example-dev"
      },
      "policyKind": "PRINCIPAL_ACCESS_BOUNDARY",
      "policy": "organizations/0123456789012/locations/global/principalAccessBoundaryPolicies/example-dev-only",
      "condition": {
        "title": "Only service accounts",
        "description": "Only enforce the policy if the principal in the request is a service account",
        "expression": "principal.type == 'iam.googleapis.com/ServiceAccount'"
      }
    }

If this is the only Principal Access Boundary policy that the service accounts are subject to, then the service accounts will be ineligible to use any permissions that the Principal Access Boundary policy can block to access any resources outside of `example-dev` .

## Manage eligibility for different groups of principals

You can use multiple Principal Access Boundary policies in the same organization to make different principals eligible to access different resources. When using multiple Principal Access Boundary policies, use [conditions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies#conditions) in your policy bindings to ensure that each policy only applies to the principals that you want it to apply to.

For example, imagine that you want most principals to be eligible to access all resources in your organization, as shown in [Prevent users from accessing resources outside of your organization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies-use-cases#use-case-org-only) . However, you also want to make sure the service accounts in `example-dev` are only eligible to access resources in `example-dev` , as shown in [Make service accounts eligible to access resources in a single project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies-use-cases#use-case-one-project) .

To achieve this goal, you do the following:

1.  Following the example in [Prevent users from accessing resources outside of your organization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies-use-cases#use-case-org-only) , you create a Principal Access Boundary policy that makes principals eligible to access resources in `example.com` and bind it to the organization principal set.

2.  Following the example in [Make service accounts eligible to access resources in a single project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies-use-cases#use-case-one-project) , you create a Principal Access Boundary policy that makes service accounts in `example-dev` eligible to access resources in `example-dev` and bind it to the service accounts in `example-dev` .

3.  You exempt the service accounts in `example-dev` from the Principal Access Boundary policy that makes principals eligible to access all resources in `example.com` . To do this, you add the following condition to the policy binding that attaches that Principal Access Boundary policy to the organization's principal set:
    
        "condition": {
          "title": "Exempt example-dev service accounts",
          "description": "Don't enforce the policy for service accounts in the example-dev project",
          "expression": "principal.type != 'iam.googleapis.com/ServiceAccount' || (!principal.subject.endsWith('@example-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com') && principal.subject != 'example-dev@appspot.gserviceaccount.com' && principal.subject != '901234567890-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com')"
        }

This last step is critical—if you don't exempt the `example-dev` service accounts from the initial Principal Access Boundary policy, then that policy will make them eligible to access all resources in `example.com` , regardless of the other Principal Access Boundary policies they're subject to. For more information, see [Defining eligible resources](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies#define-resources) .

It's also important to create and attach a new Principal Access Boundary policy to the `example-dev` service accounts *before* exempting them from the initial Principal Access Boundary policy. Following this procedure ensures that the service accounts are always subject to at least one Principal Access Boundary policy, which prevents them from becoming [eligible to access all Google Cloud resources](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies#define-resources) . For more information about safely reducing the resources that a principal is eligible to access, see [Reduce the resources that principals are eligible to access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/principal-access-boundary-policies-remove#reduce-eligibility) .
