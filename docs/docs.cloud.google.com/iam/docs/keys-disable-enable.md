description: How to disable and enable service account keys.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

This page explains how to disable and enable service account keys using the Google Cloud console, the [Google Cloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) , the [Identity and Access Management API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest) , or one of the [Google Cloud Client Libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/apis/docs/cloud-client-libraries) .

> **Note:** Service account keys are a security risk if not managed correctly. You should [choose a more secure alternative to service account keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#auth-decision-tree) whenever possible. If you must authenticate with a service account key, you are responsible for the security of the private key and for other operations described by [Best practices for managing service account keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-for-managing-service-account-keys) . If you are prevented from creating a service account key, service account key creation might be disabled for your organization. For more information, see [Managing secure-by-default organization resources](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/secure-by-default-organizations) .
> 
> If you acquired the service account key from an external source, you must validate it before use. For more information, see [Security requirements for externally sourced credentials](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/externally-sourced-credentials) .

## Before you begin

  - Enable the IAM API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

  - Set up authentication.
    
    Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
    
    ### gcloud
    
    In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
    
    ### Java
    
    To use the Java samples on this page in a local development environment, install and initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with your user credentials.
    
    1.  [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
    
    2.  If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    3.  If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account:
        
            gcloud auth application-default login
        
        You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
        
        If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider (IdP), confirm that you have [signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.
    
    ### REST
    
    To use the REST API samples on this page in a local development environment, you use the credentials you provide to the gcloud CLI.
    
    For more information, see [Authenticate for using REST](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/rest) in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

  - Understand [service account credentials](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-creds) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to disable and enable service account keys, ask your administrator to grant you the [Service Account Key Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin) ( `roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin` ) IAM role on the project, or the service account whose keys you want to manage. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

IAM basic roles also contain permissions to manage service account keys. You should not grant basic roles in a production environment, but you can grant them in a development or test environment.

## Disable a service account key

Disabling a service account key prevents you from using the key to authenticate with Google APIs. You can [enable a disabled key](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-disable-enable#enabling) at any time.

> **Important:** Disabling a service account key does not revoke short-lived credentials that were issued based on the key. To revoke a compromised short-lived credential, you must [disable or delete the service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-disable-enable#disabling) that the credential represents. If you do so, any workload that uses the service account will immediately lose access to your resources.

Before you [delete a service account key](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#deleting) , we recommend that you disable the key, then wait until you are sure that the key is no longer needed. You can then delete the key.

You can view disabled keys in the Google Cloud console, but you cannot use the Google Cloud console to disable a key. Use the gcloud CLI or the REST API instead.

### gcloud

Execute the [`gcloud iam service-accounts keys disable`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/service-accounts/keys/disable) command to disable a service account key.

Replace the following values:

  - `  KEY_ID  ` : The ID of the key to disable. To find the key's ID, [list all keys for the service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-list-get#list-keys) , identify the key that you want to disable, and then copy its ID.
  - `  SA_NAME  ` : The name of the service account that the key belongs to.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID.

<!-- end list -->

    gcloud iam service-accounts keys disable KEY_ID \
        --iam-account=SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
        --project=PROJECT_ID

Output:

    Disabled key [KEY_ID] for service account
    [SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com]

        String email = String.format("%s@%s.iam.gserviceaccount.com", accountName, projectId);
        String name = String.format("projects/%s/serviceAccounts/%s/keys/%s", projectId, email, key);
    
        // Initialize client that will be used to send requests.
        // This client only needs to be created once, and can be reused for multiple requests.
        try (IAMClient iamClient = IAMClient.create()) {
          iamClient.disableServiceAccountKey(name);

## Enable a service account key

After you disable a service account key, you can enable the key at any time, then use the key to authenticate with Google APIs.

You cannot use the Google Cloud console to enable service account keys. Use the gcloud CLI or the REST API instead.

### gcloud

Execute the [`gcloud iam service-accounts keys enable`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/service-accounts/keys/enable) command to enable a service account key.

Replace the following values:

  - `  KEY_ID  ` : The ID of the key to enable. To find the key's ID, [list all keys for the service account](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-list-get#list-keys) , identify the key that you want to enable, and then copy its ID.
  - `  SA_NAME  ` : The name of the service account that the key belongs to.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID.
