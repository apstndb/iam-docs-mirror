title: Monitor usage patterns for service accounts and keys
description: Fine-grained access control and visibility for centrally managing cloud resources.

---

This page explains how to use Cloud Monitoring to view usage metrics for your service accounts and service account keys. These metrics let you view and track usage patterns, which can help you identify anomalies, either automatically or manually.

> **Note:** To quickly identify the dates of only the most recent service account and key usages, see [View recent usage for service accounts and keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-recent-usage) .

Service accounts and service account keys appear in these metrics if they are used to call any Google API, including APIs that are not part of Google Cloud. The metrics include both successful and failed API calls. For example, if an API call fails because the caller is not authorized to call that API, or because the request referred to a resource that does not exist, the service account or key that was used for that API call appears in the metrics.

Service account keys also appear in these metrics if a system lists the keys while attempting to authenticate a request, even if the system doesn't use the key to authenticate the request. This behavior is most common when using [signed URLs for Cloud Storage](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls) or when authenticating to third-party applications. As a result it is possible to see usage metrics for keys that have not been used for authentication.

The following don't appear in either service account or service account key metrics:

  - Cloud Storage HMAC authentication keys
  - Requests authenticated by [API keys bound to service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys#api-keys-bound-sa)

Monitoring retains service account metrics for 6 weeks. If you need to access data for a longer time period, you can periodically export the results to BigQuery. For more information, see [Monitoring metric export](https://docs.cloud.google.com/solutions/stackdriver-monitoring-metric-export) in the Solutions documentation.

After you use a service account or service account key, usage metrics are usually available within a few minutes.

## Before you begin

  - Enable the IAM and Cloud Monitoring APIs.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to view recent usage for service accounts and keys, ask your administrator to grant you the [Monitoring Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/monitoring#monitoring.viewer) ( `roles/monitoring.viewer` ) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## View usage metrics for all service accounts or keys

To view the usage metrics for your service accounts or service account keys, follow these steps:

### Console

To view the metrics for a monitored resource by using the Metrics Explorer, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the *leaderboard* **Metrics explorer** page:
    
    If you use the search bar to find this page, then select the result whose subheading is **Monitoring** .

2.  In the toolbar of the Google Cloud console, select your Google Cloud project. For [App Hub](https://docs.cloud.google.com/app-hub/docs/overview) configurations, select the App Hub host project or the app-enabled folder's management project.

3.  In the **Metric** element, expand the **Select a metric** menu, enter `IAM Service Account` in the filter bar, and then use the submenus to select a specific resource type and metric:
    
    1.  In the **Active resources** menu, select **IAM Service Account** .
    2.  In the **Active metric categories** menu, select **Service\_account** .
    3.  In the **Active metrics** menu, select a service account metric. The following metrics are available within your selected time interval:
          - For service account usage metrics, select **Service account authentication events** .
          - For service account key usage metrics, select **Service account key authentication events** .
    4.  Click **Apply** .

4.  To add filters, which remove time series from the query results, use the [**Filter** element](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/charts/metrics-selector#filter-option) .

5.  To combine time series, use the menus on the [**Aggregation** element](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/charts/metrics-selector#select_display) . For example, to display the CPU utilization for your VMs, based on their zone, set the first menu to **Mean** and the second menu to **zone** .
    
    All time series are displayed when the first menu of the **Aggregation** element is set to **Unaggregated** . The default settings for the **Aggregation** element are determined by the metric type you selected.

6.  For quota and other metrics that report one sample per day, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Display** pane, set the **Widget type** to **Stacked bar chart** .
    2.  Set the time period to at least one week.

> **Note:** Service account metrics include disabled service accounts. Service account key metrics *do not* include disabled service account keys, but they might include expired or deleted service account keys.

### REST

The Cloud Monitoring API API's `  timeSeries.list  ` method allows you to access usage metrics programmatically.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .

              "keyOrigin": "GOOGLE_PROVIDED",
              "keyType": "USER_MANAGED"
            },
            {
              "name": "projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com/keys/e5e3800831ac1adc8a5849da7d827b4724b1fce8",

              "keyType": "USER_MANAGED"
            },
            {
              "name": "projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com/keys/b97699f042b8eee6a846f4f96259fbcd13e2682e",

            }
          ]
        }

2.  Use the metadata in the response to identify the key you want to track. Then, copy the key's unique ID from the end of the `name` field.
    
    The `name` field has the following format:
    
        "name": "projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL/keys/KEY_ID"
    
    The key's unique ID is everything after `keys/` .
    
    For example, the unique ID in the following key name is `0f561cc41650ff521899de2fd653bd3de08e2da4` :
    
        "name": "projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/my-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com/keys/0f561cc41650ff521899de2fd653bd3de08e2da4"

**Then, use the ID to view usage metrics for the service account key.**

The Cloud Monitoring API's `  timeSeries.list  ` method , when used with specific filters, allows you to get usage metrics for a single service account key. You can then use those metrics to determine when the key was last used.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .
  - `  KEY_ID  ` : The unique ID of your service account key.
  - `  END_TIME  ` : The end of the time interval that you want to check, in percent-encoded [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format. For example, `2020-06-12T00%3A00%3A00.00Z` .
  - `  START_TIME  ` : The start of the time interval that you want to check, in percent-encoded [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format. For example, `2020-04-12T00%3A00%3A00.00Z` .
