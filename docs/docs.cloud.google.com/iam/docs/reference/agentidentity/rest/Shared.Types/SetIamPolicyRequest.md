Fields

`resource`

`string`

REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field.

`policy`

` object ( Policy  ` )

REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource` . The size of the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is a valid policy but certain Google Cloud services (such as Projects) might reject them.

`updateMask`

` string ( FieldMask  ` format)

OPTIONAL: A FieldMask specifying which fields of the policy to modify. Only the fields in the mask will be modified. If no mask is provided, the following default mask is used:

`paths: "bindings, etag"`

This is a comma-separated list of fully qualified names of fields. Example: `"user.displayName,photo"` .
