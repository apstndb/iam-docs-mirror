Fields

`role`

`string`

Role that is assigned to the list of `members` , or principals. For example, `roles/viewer` , `roles/editor` , or `roles/owner` .

For an overview of the IAM roles and permissions, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview) . For a list of the available pre-defined roles, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .

`members[]`

`string`

Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. `members` can have the following values:

  - `allUsers` : A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.

  - `allAuthenticatedUsers` : A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation.

  - `user:{emailid}` : An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` .

<!-- end list -->

  - `serviceAccount:{emailid}` : An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com` .

  - `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]` : An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts) . For example, `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]` .

  - `group:{emailid}` : An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com` .

<!-- end list -->

  - `domain:{domain}` : The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com` .

<!-- end list -->

  - `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}` : A single identity in a workforce identity pool.

  - `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/group/{groupId}` : All workforce identities in a group.

  - `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}` : All workforce identities with a specific attribute value.

  - `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/*` : All identities in a workforce identity pool.

  - `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}` : A single identity in a workload identity pool.

  - `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/group/{groupId}` : A workload identity pool group.

  - `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}` : All identities in a workload identity pool with a certain attribute.

  - `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/*` : All identities in a workload identity pool.

  - `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}` : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901` . If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding.

  - `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}` : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901` . If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding.

  - `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}` : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901` . If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding.

  - `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}` : Deleted single identity in a workforce identity pool. For example, `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value` .

`condition`

` object ( Expr  ` )

The condition that is associated with this binding.

If the condition evaluates to `true` , then this binding applies to the current request.

If the condition evaluates to `false` , then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this binding.

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies) .
