  - `  Status  ` (message)

## Status

The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc) . Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors) .

Fields

`code`

`int32`

The status code, which should be an enum value of `google.rpc.Code` .

`message`

`string`

A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the `  google.rpc.Status.details  ` field, or localized by the client.

`details[]`

`  Any  `

A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
