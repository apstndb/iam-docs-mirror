title: Configure Workforce Identity Federation with PingFederate
description: Fine-grained access control and visibility for centrally managing cloud resources.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

This document shows you how to configure Workforce Identity Federation with the PingFederate identity provider (IdP) and manage access to Google Cloud. After you configure the PingFederate IdP, federated users can access Google Cloud services that [support Workforce Identity Federation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/federated-identity-supported-services) by using the SAML 2.0 protocol.

## Before you begin

1.  Make sure that you set up a Google Cloud organization.

2.  [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI. After installation, [initialize](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
    
        gcloud init
    
    If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    > **Note:** If you installed the gcloud CLI previously, make sure you have the latest version by running `gcloud components update` .

3.  For sign-in, your IdP must provide signed authentication information: SAML IdP responses must be signed.

4.  To receive important information about changes to your organization or Google Cloud products, you must provide [Essential Contacts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/managing-notification-contacts) . For more information, see the [Workforce Identity Federation overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#essential-contacts) .

## Costs

Workforce Identity Federation is available as a no-cost feature. However, Workforce Identity Federation detailed audit logging uses Cloud Logging. To learn about Logging pricing, see [Google Cloud Observability pricing](https://docs.cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing#logs-costs) .

## Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to configure Workforce Identity Federation, ask your administrator to grant you the [IAM Workforce Pool Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.workforcePoolAdmin) ( `roles/iam.workforcePoolAdmin` ) IAM role on the organization. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

If you configure permissions in a development or test environment—but not in a production environment—you can grant the IAM Owner ( `roles/owner` ) basic role. This role also includes permissions for Workforce Identity Federation.

## Create a workforce identity pool

### gcloud

To create the workforce identity pool, run the following command:

    gcloud iam workforce-pools create WORKFORCE_POOL_ID \
        --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID \
        --display-name="DISPLAY_NAME" \
        --description="DESCRIPTION" \
        --session-duration=SESSION_DURATION \
        --location=global

Replace the following:

  - `  WORKFORCE_POOL_ID  ` : an ID that you choose to represent your Google Cloud workforce pool. The pool ID must be globally unique across all workforce identity pools in Google Cloud. For information on formatting the ID, see the [Query parameters](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/locations.workforcePools.providers/create#query-parameters) section in the API documentation.
  - `  ORGANIZATION_ID  ` : the numeric organization ID of your Google Cloud organization for the workforce identity pool. Workforce identity pools are available across all projects and folders in the organization.
  - `  DISPLAY_NAME  ` : Optional. A display name for your workforce identity pool.
  - `  DESCRIPTION  ` : Optional. A workforce identity pool description.
  - `  SESSION_DURATION  ` : Optional. The session duration, expressed as a number appended with `s` —for example, `3600s` . Session duration determines how long the Google Cloud access tokens, [console (federated)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#console-federated) sign-in sessions, and gcloud CLI sign-in sessions from this workforce pool are valid. Session duration defaults to one hour (3600s). The session duration value must be between 15 minutes (900s) and 12 hours (43200s).

> **Tip:** Run `gcloud iam workforce-pools create --help` to find other parameters you can customize for this command.

### Console

To create the workforce identity pool, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Workforce Identity Pools** page:

2.  Select the organization for your workforce identity pool. Workforce identity pools are available across all projects and folders in an organization.

3.  Click **Create pool** and do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Name** field, enter the display name of the pool. The pool ID is automatically derived from the name as you type, and it is displayed under the **Name** field. You can update the pool ID by clicking **Edit** next to the pool ID.
    
    2.  Optional: In **Description** , enter a description of the pool.
    
    3.  To create the workforce identity pool, click **Next** .

The workforce identity pool's session duration defaults to one hour (3600s). The session duration determines how long the Google Cloud access tokens, [console (federated)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#console-federated) , and gcloud CLI sign-in sessions from this workforce pool are valid. After you create the pool, you can [update the pool](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#update-pool) to set a custom session duration. The session duration must be from 15 minutes (900s) to 12 hours (43200s).

## Create a PingFederate application

This section shows you how to create a PingFederate application integration.

To set up a PingFederate application that uses the SAML 2.0 protocol, do the following in PingFederate:

1.  Set the **SAML 2.0 Entity ID** of your PingFederate IdP. For details, see [Specifying federation information](https://docs.pingidentity.com/pingfederate/12.2/administrators_reference_guide/help_protocolsettingstasklet_federationinfostate.html) .

2.  Create a SAML 2.0 SP connection, see [Choosing an SP connection type](https://cdn-docs.pingidentity.com/archive/pdf/pingfederate/pingfederate-101.pdf) and do the following:
    
    1.  In **Connection Type** , select **Browser SSO Profiles** and **SAML 2.0 protocol** .
    2.  In **Import Metadata** , select **None** .

3.  In **General Info** , set the **Partner's Entity ID (Connection ID)** to the following:
    
        https://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID

4.  In **SAML Profiles** , enable **SP-initiated SSO** . If you plan to also use IdP-initiated single sign-on (SSO), you can also enable it.

5.  In **Attribute Contract** , define custom attributes (for example, email and groups) to be passed in the assertion. These attributes can be used in Google Cloud to create access management policies later.

6.  In **Attribute Contract Fulfillment** , make sure that `SAML_SUBJECT` is mapped to a field that has a unique value for each user. For example, an email address is typically unique for each user, doesn't change, and is often used to refer to a specific user in Google Cloud access management policies.

7.  To set up console (federated) sign-in, in **Assertion Consumer Service URL** , add the following endpoint URL:
    
        https://auth.cloud.google/signin-callback/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  WORKFORCE_POOL_ID  ` : the ID of the workforce pool that you created earlier.
      - `  WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID  ` : the ID of the workforce provider that you create later.

8.  Set **Binding** for this endpoint to **POST** .

9.  To enable console (federated) sign-in, in **Allowable SAML Bindings** , select **Redirect** .

10. For **Signature Policy** , select **Sign Response As Required** .

11. Save and activate the connection.

### Use attributes

This section describes how to use attributes from the SAML assertion.

Use *attribute contracts* to specify the custom attributes in the generated SAML assertions. After you configure attributes, you can use them in Google Cloud to create access management policies. To learn more about attribute contracts, refer to *Attribute contracts* in the PingFederate server documentation.

For example, in this guide we use PingOne as the datastore for PingFederate and map the `email` , `firstName` , and `groups` attribute contracts using the [user attributes](https://docs.pingidentity.com/bundle/pingone/page/tip1564020491298.html) from the PingOne datastore, as follows:

| Attribute Contract | Value              |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `email`            | `email`            |
| `firstName`        | `name.given`       |
| `groups`           | `memberOfGroupIDs` |

## Create the PingFederate workforce identity pool provider

This section describes how to create a [workforce identity pool provider](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-identity-pool-providers) to enable your IdP users to access Google Cloud. You can configure the provider to use the SAML protocol.

### Create a SAML 2.0 workforce identity pool provider

1.  To configure the SAML application, do the following:
    
    ### gcloud
    
    To create the SAML workforce identity pool provider, run the following command:
    
        gcloud iam workforce-pools providers create-saml WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID \
            --workforce-pool="WORKFORCE_POOL_ID" \
            --display-name="DISPLAY_NAME" \
            --description="DESCRIPTION" \
            --idp-metadata-path="XML_METADATA_PATH" \
            --attribute-mapping="ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING" \
            --attribute-condition="ATTRIBUTE_CONDITION" \
            --location=global
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID  ` : a provider ID.
      - `  WORKFORCE_POOL_ID  ` : the workforce identity pool ID.
      - `  DISPLAY_NAME  ` : a display name.
      - `  DESCRIPTION  ` : a description.
      - `  XML_METADATA_PATH  ` : the path to the XML-formatted metadata file from PingFederate.
      - `  ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING  ` : the [attribute mapping](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-mappings) ; for example, `google.subject=assertion.subject,google.groups=assertion.attributes.groups,attribute.department=assertion.attributes.department[0]` .
      - `  ATTRIBUTE_CONDITION  ` : an optional [attribute condition](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#attribute-conditions) ; for example, to limit the `ipaddr` attribute to a certain IP range, set the condition to `assertion.ipaddr.startsWith('98.11.12.')` .
    
    This command assigns the `subject` , `groups` , and `department` in the SAML assertion to `google.subject` , `google.groups` , and `attribute.department` attributes, respectively. The attribute condition also ensures that only users within a certain IP range can sign in using this workforce provider.
    
    ### Console
    
    To configure the SAML provider by using the Google Cloud console, do the following:
    
    1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Workforce Identity Pools** page:
    
    2.  In the **Workforce Identity Pools** table, select the pool that you want to create the provider for.
    
    3.  In the **Providers** section, click **add Add Provider** .
    
    4.  In the **Select a Provider vendor** list, select **Generic Identity Provider** .
    
    5.  In **Select an authentication protocol** , select **SAML** .
    
    6.  In the **Create a provider** section, do the following:
        
        1.  In **Name** , enter a name for the provider.
        2.  In **IDP metadata file (XML)** , select the metadata XML file from PingFederate.
        3.  Click **Continue** .
    
    7.  In the **Share your provider information** section, click **Continue** .
    
    8.  In the **Configure provider** section, do the following:
        
        1.  In **Attribute mapping** , enter a CEL expression for `google.subject` (for example, `assertion.subject` ).
        
        2.  Optional: To enter other mappings, click **Add mapping** and enter other mappings—for example:
            
                google.subject=assertion.subject,
                google.groups=assertion.attributes['https://example.com/aliases'],
                attribute.costcenter=assertion.attributes.costcenter[0]
    
    9.  To turn on detailed audit logging, in **Detailed logging** , click the **Enable attribute value audit logging** toggle.
    
    10. To create the provider, click **Submit** .

## Manage access to Google Cloud resources

This section shows how to manage access to Google Cloud resources for PingFederate users.

The sample project that's used in this guide can be different from the project you used to set up Workforce Identity Federation.

You can manage roles for single identities, a group of identities, or an entire pool. For more information, see [Workforce principal identifiers for allow policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation#representing-workforce-users) .

### Use mapped department attributes

To grant the Storage Admin role ( `roles/storage.admin` ) to all identities within a specific department for the `  TEST_PROJECT_ID  ` project, run the following command:

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding TEST_PROJECT_ID \
        --role="roles/storage.admin" \
        --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/attribute.department/DEPARTMENT_VALUE"

Replace the following:

  - `  TEST_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID.
  - `  WORKFORCE_POOL_ID  ` : the workforce identity pool ID.
  - `  DEPARTMENT_VALUE  ` : the mapped `attribute.department` value.

### Use mapped groups

To grant the Storage Admin role ( `roles/storage.admin` ) to all identities within the `  GROUP_ID  ` group for the `  TEST_PROJECT_ID  ` project, run the following command:

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding TEST_PROJECT_ID \
        --role="roles/storage.admin" \
        --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/group/GROUP_ID"

Replace the following:

  - `  TEST_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID.
  - `  WORKFORCE_POOL_ID  ` : the workforce identity pool ID.
  - `  GROUP_ID  ` : a group in the mapped `google.groups` claim.

## Sign in and test access

In this section, you sign in as a workforce identity pool user and test your access.

### Sign in

### console (federated) sign-in

To sign in to the Google Cloud Workforce Identity Federation console, also known as the console (federated), do the following:

1.  Go to the console (federated) sign-in page.

2.  Enter the provider name, which is formatted as follows:
    
        locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID

### gcloud CLI browser-based sign-in

To sign in to gcloud CLI using a browser-based sign-in flow:

Run the following command to create a login configuration file:

### Linux and macOS

    gcloud iam workforce-pools create-login-config \
        locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID \
        --output-file=LOGIN_CONFIG_PATH

### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud iam workforce-pools create-login-config `
        locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID `
        --output-file=LOGIN_CONFIG_PATH

> **Note:** You can optionally activate the login configuration file as the default for the gcloud CLI by adding the [`--activate`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workforce-pools/create-login-config#--activate) flag. You can then run `gcloud auth login` to authorize the gcloud CLI without specifying the login configuration file path each time.

Replace the following:

  - `  WORKFORCE_POOL_ID  ` : The Workforce Identity Federation pool ID.
  - `  WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID  ` : The Workforce Identity Federation provider ID.
  - `  LOGIN_CONFIG_PATH  ` : The path to write the login configuration file to. For example, `login-config.json` .

The login configuration file contains the endpoints used by the gcloud CLI to enable the browser-based authentication flow and set the audience to the IdP that was configured in the workforce identity pool provider. The file doesn't contain confidential information.

The login configuration file content looks similar to the following:

    {
      "universe_domain": "googleapis.com",
      "universe_cloud_web_domain": "cloud.google",
      "type": "external_account_authorized_user_login_config",
      "audience": "//iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID",
      "auth_url": "https://auth.cloud.google/authorize",
      "token_url": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/oauthtoken",
      "token_info_url": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/introspect"
    }

> **Caution:** We recommend that you first ensure that the contents of this file are correct and then safeguard the file—for example, by making it read-only and restricting access with an ACL. The file isn't validated; a malicious actor with write access to this file can change the endpoints and intercept credentials.

Point to the login configuration file with an environment variable, a property in the active gcloud CLI configuration, or use it directly with the `gcloud auth login` command:

### Environment variable

To use the login configuration file with an environment variable, complete the following instructions:

1.  Set the `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_LOGIN_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to the path of the login configuration file.

2.  Run the following command:
    
        gcloud auth login

3.  The gcloud CLI references the environment variable to find the login configuration file, and then starts the authentication process. Follow the browser-based flow to authenticate and authorize the gcloud CLI to access resources on your behalf for future commands.

To stop using the login configuration file for `gcloud auth login` commands, clear the `CLOUDSDK_AUTH_LOGIN_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

### gcloud CLI configuration

To use the login configuration file with a gcloud CLI configuration property, complete the following instructions:

1.  Set the active gcloud CLI configuration's `auth/login_config_file` property to the login configuration file's path with the following command:
    
        gcloud config set auth/login_config_file LOGIN_CONFIG_PATH

2.  Run the following command:
    
        gcloud auth login

3.  The gcloud CLI references the configuration property to find the login configuration file, and then starts the authentication process. Follow the browser-based flow to authenticate and authorize the gcloud CLI to access resources on your behalf for future commands.

To stop using the login configuration file for `gcloud auth login` commands, unset the property with the following command:

    gcloud config unset auth/login_config_file

### gcloud auth login

To use the login configuration file directly with the `gcloud auth login` command, complete the following instructions:

  - If you used the `--activate` flag when you created the login configuration file, run the following command:
    
        gcloud auth login

  - If you didn't use the `--activate` flag when you created the login configuration file, run the following command:
    
    ### Linux and macOS
    
        gcloud auth login \
            --login-config=LOGIN_CONFIG_PATH
    
    ### Windows (PowerShell)
    
        gcloud auth login `
            --login-config=LOGIN_CONFIG_PATH
    
    Replace LOGIN\_CONFIG\_PATH with the path of your login configuration file.

The [gcloud auth login](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) command stores access credentials in your home directory. The authenticated principal becomes the active principal in your active gcloud CLI configuration. Unless overridden, the gcloud CLI uses these stored credentials to access Google Cloud.

> **Caution** : Any user with access to your file system can use the stored access credentials created by `gcloud auth login` . To reduce the consequences of a system being compromised, strictly separate human and workload use, and don't use `gcloud auth login` for automated workloads on remote systems with persistent storage. Where possible, use a secret manager in combination with environment variables instead.
> 
> For more guidance on hardening remote systems, see [Mitigating compromised OAuth tokens for Google Cloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/bps-for-mitigating-gcloud-oauth-tokens) .

### gcloud CLI headless sign-in

To sign in to PingFederate with the gcloud CLI using the SAML protocol, do the following:

1.  Sign in a user to your PingFederate app and get the SAML response.

2.  Save the SAML response returned by PingFederate in a secure location on your local machine. Store the path in an environment variable—for example: `SAML_ASSERTION_PATH=/path/to/assertion.xml` .

3.  Generate a configuration file:
    
        gcloud iam workforce-pools create-cred-config \
            locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID \
            --subject-token-type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2 \
            --credential-source-file=SAML_ASSERTION_PATH \
            --workforce-pool-user-project=PROJECT_ID \
            --output-file=config.json
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  SAML_ASSERTION_PATH  ` : the path of the SAML assertion file.
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID.

4.  The configuration file that's generated looks similar to the following:
    
        {
          "type": "external_account",
          "audience": "//iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/WORKFORCE_PROVIDER_ID",
          "subject_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2",
          "token_url": "https://sts.googleapis.com/v1/token",
          "credential_source": {
            "file": "SAML_ASSERTION_PATH"
          },
          "workforce_pool_user_project": "PROJECT_ID"
        }

5.  To sign in to the gcloud CLI using token exchange, run the following command:
    
        gcloud auth login --cred-file=config.json
    
    `gcloud` then transparently exchanges your PingFederate credentials for temporary Google Cloud access tokens, allowing you to make other `gcloud` calls to Google Cloud. The output is similar to the following:
    
    `Authenticated with external account user credentials for: [principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/ WORKFORCE_POOL_ID /subject/ USER_ID ].`

6.  To list the credentialed accounts and the active account, run the following command:
    
        gcloud auth list

### Test access

You have access to Google Cloud services that support Workforce Identity Federation and to which you are granted access. Earlier in this guide, you granted the Storage Admin role to all identities within a specific department or group for project `  TEST_PROJECT_ID  ` . You can test that you have access by listing Cloud Storage buckets.

### console (federated) sign-in

To verify your access in the console (federated), do the following:

1.  Go to the [Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) page.
2.  Verify that you can see the list of existing buckets for the project `  TEST_PROJECT_ID  ` .

### gcloud CLI

To list Cloud Storage buckets and objects for the project that you have access to, run the following command:

    gcloud alpha storage ls --project="TEST_PROJECT_ID"

The principal must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the project set in the gcloud CLI session: `  PROJECT_ID  ` .
