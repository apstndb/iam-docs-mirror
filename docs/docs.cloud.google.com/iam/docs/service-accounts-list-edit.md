description: How list and edit a service account.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

This page explains how to list and edit service accounts using the Identity and Access Management (IAM) API, the Google Cloud console, and the `gcloud` command- line tool.

## Before you begin

  - Enable the IAM API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ), which contains the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

  - Set up authentication.
    
    Select the tab for how you plan to use the samples on this page:
    
    ### Console
    
    When you use the Google Cloud console to access Google Cloud services and APIs, you don't need to set up authentication.
    
    ### gcloud
    
    In the Google Cloud console, activate Cloud Shell.
    
    At the bottom of the Google Cloud console, a [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works) session starts and displays a command-line prompt. Cloud Shell is a shell environment with the Google Cloud CLI already installed and with values already set for your current project. It can take a few seconds for the session to initialize.
    
    ### C\#
    
    To use the .NET samples on this page in a local development environment, install and initialize the gcloud CLI, and then set up Application Default Credentials with your user credentials.
    
    1.  [Install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.
    
    2.  If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first [sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    3.  If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user account:
        
            gcloud auth application-default login
        
        You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
        
        If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider (IdP), confirm that you have [signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-log-in-gcloud) .
    
    For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

    For more information, see [Authenticate for using REST](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/rest) in the Google Cloud authentication documentation.

  - Understand [IAM service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview)

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to manage service accounts, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project:

  - To view service accounts: [View Service Accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountViewer) ( `roles/iam.serviceAccountViewer` )
  - To edit service accounts: [Service Account Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountAdmin) ( `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

IAM basic roles also contain permissions to manage service accounts. You should not grant basic roles in a production environment, but you can grant them in a development or test environment.

## Listing service accounts

You can list the [user-managed service accounts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#user-managed) in a project to help you audit service accounts and keys, or as part of a custom tool for managing service accounts.

You can't list the [service agents](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-agents) that might appear in your project's allow policy and audit logs. Service agents aren't located in your project, and you can't access them directly.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Service accounts** page.

2.  Select a project.
    
    The **Service accounts** page lists all of the user-managed service accounts in the project you selected.

### gcloud

The `  gcloud iam service-accounts list  ` command lists every user-managed service account in the specified project.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=PROJECT_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=PROJECT_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=PROJECT_ID

You should receive a response similar to the following:

    DISPLAY NAME: SA_DISPLAY_NAME_1
    EMAIL: SA_NAME_1@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    DISABLED: False
    
    DISPLAY NAME: SA_DISPLAY_NAME_2
    EMAIL: SA_NAME_2@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    DISABLED: False

### REST

The `  serviceAccounts.list  ` method lists every user-managed service account in the specified project.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .

HTTP method and URL:

    GET https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    curl -X GET \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method GET `
        -Headers $headers `
        -Uri "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts" | Select-Object -Expand Content

#### APIs Explorer (browser)

Open the [method reference page](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts/list) . The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page. You can interact with this tool to send requests. Complete any required fields and click **Execute** .

You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:

    {
      "accounts": [
        {
          "name": "projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/sa-1@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
          "projectId": "my-project",
          "uniqueId": "123456789012345678901",
          "email": "sa-1@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
          "description": "My first service account",
          "displayName": "Service account 1",
          "etag": "BwUpTsLVUkQ=",
          "oauth2ClientId": "987654321098765432109"
        },
        {
          "name": "projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/sa-2@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
          "projectId": "my-project",
          "uniqueId": "234567890123456789012",
          "email": "sa-2@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
          "description": "My second service account",
          "displayName": "Service account 2",
          "etag": "UkQpTwBVUsL=",
          "oauth2ClientId": "876543210987654321098"
        }
      ]
    }

## Edit a service account

The display name (friendly name) and description of a service account are commonly used to capture additional information about the service account, such as the purpose of the service account or a contact person for the account.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Service accounts** page.

2.  Select a project.

3.  Click the email address of the service account that you want to rename.

4.  Enter the new name in the **Name** box, then click **Save** .

### gcloud

The `  gcloud iam service-accounts update  ` command updates a service account.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

`  SA_NAME  ` : The alphanumeric ID of your service account. This name must be between 6 and 30 characters, and can contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.

`  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .

Replace at least one of the following:

  - `  UPDATED_DISPLAY_NAME  ` : A new display name for your service account.
  - `  UPDATED_DESCRIPTION  ` : A new description for your service account.

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud iam service-accounts update \
        SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
        --project=PROJECT_ID
        --description="UPDATED_SA_DESCRIPTION" \
        --display-name="UPDATED_DISPLAY_NAME"

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud iam service-accounts update `
        SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com `
        --project=PROJECT_ID
        --description="UPDATED_SA_DESCRIPTION" `
        --display-name="UPDATED_DISPLAY_NAME"

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud iam service-accounts update ^
        SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com ^
        --project=PROJECT_ID
        --description="UPDATED_SA_DESCRIPTION" ^
        --display-name="UPDATED_DISPLAY_NAME"

You should receive a response similar to the following:

    Updated serviceAccount [SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com].
    description: UPDATED_SA_DESCRIPTION
    displayName: UPDATED_DISPLAY_NAME
    name: projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

### REST

The `  serviceAccounts.patch  ` method updates a service account.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

`  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` .

`  SA_ID  ` : The ID of your service account. This can either be the service account's email address in the form `  SA_NAME @ PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com ` , or the service account's unique numeric ID.

`  SA_NAME  ` : The alphanumeric ID of your service account. This name must be between 6 and 30 characters, and can contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.

Replace at least one of the following:

  - `  UPDATED_DISPLAY_NAME  ` : A new display name for your service account.
  - `  UPDATED_DESCRIPTION  ` : A new description for your service account.

HTTP method and URL:

    PATCH https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID

Request JSON body:

    {
      "serviceAccount": {
        "email": "SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
        "displayName": "UPDATED_DISPLAY_NAME",
        "description": "UPDATED_DESCRIPTION"
      },
      "updateMask": "displayName,description"
    }

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) , or by using [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs) , which automatically logs you into the `gcloud` CLI . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Save the request body in a file named `request.json` , and execute the following command:

    curl -X PATCH \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
         -d @request.json \
         "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID"

#### PowerShell (Windows)

> **Note:** The following command assumes that you have logged in to the `gcloud` CLI with your user account by running [`gcloud init`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) or [`gcloud auth login`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login) . You can check the currently active account by running [`gcloud auth list`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/list) .

Save the request body in a file named `request.json` , and execute the following command:

    $cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
    $headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred" }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest `
        -Method PATCH `
        -Headers $headers `
        -ContentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8" `
        -InFile request.json `
        -Uri "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/SA_ID" | Select-Object -Expand Content

#### APIs Explorer (browser)

Copy the request body and open the [method reference page](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts/patch) . The APIs Explorer panel opens on the right side of the page. You can interact with this tool to send requests. Paste the request body in this tool, complete any other required fields, and click **Execute** .

You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:

    {
      "name": "projects/my-project/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "displayName": "My updated service account",
      "description": "An updated description of my service account"
    }
