This guide shows you how to create and deploy an agent in Agent Runtime on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform with Agent Identity enabled.

Agent Identity assigns a secure SPIFFE identity to your deployed agent. The agent uses this identity to authenticate to Google Cloud services and retrieve credentials from the Agent Identity auth manager.

## Before you begin

1.  Enable the Agent Identity API, Agent Platform API, Agent Registry API, and App Hub API APIs.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the `serviceusage.services.enable` permission. If you created the project, then you likely already have this permission through the Owner role ( `roles/owner` ). Otherwise, you can get this permission through the Service Usage Admin role ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` ). [Learn how to grant roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

2.  Ensure you have the **Agent Platform User** ( `roles/aiplatform.user` ) role on your project.

## Create and deploy the agent

Create a sample agent using `google-agents-cli` and deploy it with Agent Identity:

1.  Install `uv` , and then run the `google-agents-cli` setup:
    
        pip install uv
        uvx google-agents-cli setup

2.  Create an agent project using the prototype template:
    
        uvx google-agents-cli create AGENT_PROJECT --prototype --yes
    
    Replace `  AGENT_PROJECT  ` with the name for your new agent project directory (for example, `maps-agent` ).
    
    This command generates the following project directory structure:
    
        AGENT_PROJECT/
        ├── app/                       # Core agent code
        │   ├── agent.py               # Main agent logic
        │   ├── fast_api_app.py        # Client application logic
        │   └── app_utils/             # App utilities and helpers
        ├── tests/                     # Unit and integration tests
        ├── GEMINI.md                  # Development guide
        └── pyproject.toml             # Project dependencies
    
    > **Note:** The previous tree highlights the relevant configuration files and might not represent all files in your directory.

3.  Rename the default application folder ( `app` ) to match your agent name ( `  AGENT_NAME  ` , for example, `maps_agent` ). Agent names must be a valid Python identifier: they must start with a letter, and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
    
        cd AGENT_PROJECT
        mv app AGENT_NAME

4.  Update your `agent.py` configuration file to reflect the new name:
    
        # In AGENT_PROJECT/AGENT_NAME/agent.pyapp=App(root_agent=root_agent,name="AGENT_NAME",)

5.  Choose a model to use, based on its [regional availability](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/resources/locations#google-models) . Update the value for `MODEL` in `agent.py` to match your chosen model.
    
    #### Workaround for models that are only available in the `global` region
    
    To use a model that's only available in the `global` region, you must modify `agent.py` so that your agent can access it.
    
    1.  Add the following imports:
        
            from functools import cached_property
            from google.genai import Client
    
    2.  Add the following subclass after the imports:
        
            class GlobalGemini(Gemini):
                @cached_property
                def api_client(self) -> Client:
                    return Client(enterprise=True, location="global")
    
    3.  Find the following code:
        
            root_agent = Agent(
                name="root_agent",
                model=Gemini(
        
        Change it to reference the new subclass:
        
            root_agent = Agent(
                name="root_agent",
                model=GlobalGemini(

6.  Enable Agent Identity by creating a config file:
    
        echo '{ "identity_type": "AGENT_IDENTITY" }' > AGENT_NAME/.agent_engine_config.json

7.  Create a `requirements.txt` file for the deployment dependencies:
    
        uv export \
            --no-emit-workspace \
            --no-hashes \
            --format requirements.txt \
            --output-file AGENT_NAME/requirements.txt

8.  Verify the project directory structure:
    
        AGENT_PROJECT/
        ├── AGENT_NAME/                 # Agent application folder
        │   ├── .agent_engine_config.json # Agent Identity configuration
        │   ├── agent.py                  # Main agent logic
        │   ├── fast_api_app.py           # Client application logic
        │   ├── requirements.txt          # Deployment dependencies
        │   └── app_utils/                # App helpers
        ├── tests/                        # Tests
        ├── GEMINI.md                     # Development guide
        └── pyproject.toml                # Project dependencies

9.  Test your agent locally:
    
        uv run adk web . --port 8501 --reload_agents
    
    > **Note:** If you're testing on Cloud Shell, you must add the `--allow_origins="*"` flag to bypass CORS issues.
    
    To validate your agent, do the following:
    
    1.  Go to `http://localhost:8501` . Alternatively, if you're using Cloud Shell, click the link provided by the web server output.
    
    2.  In the chat interface, send a test prompt to verify the response.

10. Terminate the server with `CTRL` + `C` .

11. Deploy your agent to Google Cloud:
    
        uv run adk deploy agent_engine AGENT_NAME \
            --project="PROJECT_ID" \
            --region="LOCATION"
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your Google Cloud project ID.
    
      - `  LOCATION  ` : The [supported region](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/resources/agent-locations) where you want to deploy the agent (for example, `us-west1` ).
    
    The deployment can take a few minutes to complete. After it finishes, the CLI outputs a confirmation message and a link to your agent's playground in the Google Cloud console.

12. Retrieve your agent's SPIFFE ID (Agent Identity):
    
    1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Deployments** page.
    
    2.  To copy your agent's SPIFFE ID to the clipboard, find the row that your deployed agent is in, and in the **Identity** column of that row click content\_copy **Copy to clipboard** . The identity looks similar to the following: ` principal://agents.global.org- ORGANIZATION_ID .system.id.goog/resources/aiplatform/projects/ PROJECT_NUMBER /locations/ LOCATION /reasoningEngines/ ENGINE_ID  ` .
