title: Approve or deny grants with Privileged Access Manager
description: Use Privileged Access Manager (PAM) to manage just-in-time temporary privilege elevation for select principals, and view audit logs to find out who had access to what and when.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

When an entitlement has an approval workflow, principals that are specified as approvers can approve or deny grant requests for that entitlement.

If the Security Command Center Premium or Enterprise tier is activated, then the approval workflow can have two levels of approvals. An approver can be in one or both approval levels, but can only approve once. After the required number of first-level approvals are received, email notifications are sent to second-level approvers. After the required number of second-level approvals are received, the grant moves to the `active` state. If any approver denies the grant, then the grant moves to the `denied` state and is not sent to any additional approvers. This feature is available in [preview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

Keep the following in mind when approving or denying a grant request against an entitlement:

  - You can't approve your own request.

  - If a request isn't approved or denied, its status changes to `expired` as follows:
    
      - Unscheduled grants expire if they aren't approved or denied within 24 hours of being requested.
      - Scheduled grants expire if they aren't approved or denied by their scheduled activation time.
    
    After a grant expires, a principal must make a new grant request if privilege elevation is still required.

## Approve or deny grants using the Google Cloud console

To approve or deny a grant request that has been made against an entitlement, complete the following instructions:

1.  Go to the **Privileged Access Manager** page.

2.  Click the **Approve grants** tab, followed by the **Pending approval** tab.
    
    > **Note:** Grants created on entitlements that are inherited from a parent resource appear in the **Pending approval** tab of the parent resource.

3.  In the row related to the request you want to approve or deny, click **Approve/deny** .

4.  If a justification is required, enter it in the **Comment** field. You can view the history of the grant in the **History** tab.

5.  Click either **Approve** or **Deny** .

You can view your approval history in the **My approval history** tab. Approval history is available for 30 days after an approval action has been taken. Grants created on entitlements that are inherited from a parent resource appear in the approval history of the parent resource.

> **Note:** If an entitlement is deleted, its approval history is also deleted. Recreating the entitlement with the same name and configuration doesn't restore the approval history.

## Approve or deny grants programmatically

To approve or deny grants, you need to complete the following actions:

1.  Search for entitlements you're an approver on.

2.  With the relevant entitlement ID, search for grant requests you can approve or deny.

3.  Approve or deny the grant requests.

### Search for entitlements you're an approver on

### gcloud

The `gcloud pam entitlements search` command with the `grant-approver` caller access type searches for entitlements on which you are an approver.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud pam entitlements search \
        --caller-access-type=grant-approver \
        --location=global \
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud pam entitlements search `
        --caller-access-type=grant-approver `
        --location=global `
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud pam entitlements search ^
        --caller-access-type=grant-approver ^
        --location=global ^
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

You should receive a response similar to the following:

The Privileged Access Manager API's `approveGrant` method approves a specific grant request.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

  - `  SCOPE  ` : The organization, folder, or project that the entitlement is in, in the format of ` organizations/ ORGANIZATION_ID  ` , ` folders/ FOLDER_ID  ` , or ` projects/ PROJECT_ID  ` . Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .
  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  GRANT_ID  ` : The ID of the grant you are approving. You can retrieve the ID by [searching for grant requests you can approve or deny](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-approve-deny-grants#search_for_grant_requests_you_can_approve_or_deny) .
  - `  REASON  ` : The reason the grant request was approved.

HTTP method and URL:

    POST https://privilegedaccessmanager.googleapis.com/v1/SCOPE/locations/global/entitlements/ENTITLEMENT_ID/grants/GRANT_ID:approve

Request JSON body:

    {
        "reason": "REASON"
    }

To send your request, expand one of these options:

#### curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)

### Deny grants programmatically

### gcloud

The `gcloud pam grants describe` command denies a specific grant request.

Before using any of the command data below, make the following replacements:

  - `  GRANT_ID  ` : The ID of the grant you're denying. You can retrieve the ID by [searching for grants you can approve or deny](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-view-grants) .
  - `  ENTITLEMENT_ID  ` : The ID of the entitlement that the grant belongs to.
  - `  DENIAL_REASON  ` : Why the grant has been denied.
  - `  RESOURCE_TYPE  ` : Optional. The resource type that the entitlement belongs to. Use the value `organization` , `folder` , or `project` .
  - `  RESOURCE_ID  ` : Used with `RESOURCE_TYPE` . The ID of the Google Cloud project, folder, or organization that you want to manage entitlements for. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like `my-project` . Folder and organization IDs are numeric, like `123456789012` .

Execute the following command:

#### Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell

    gcloud pam grants deny \
        GRANT_ID \
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID \
        --reason="DENIAL_REASON" \
        --location=global \
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (PowerShell)

    gcloud pam grants deny `
        GRANT_ID `
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID `
        --reason="DENIAL_REASON" `
        --location=global `
        --RESOURCE_TYPE=RESOURCE_ID

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

    gcloud pam grants deny ^
        GRANT_ID ^
        --entitlement=ENTITLEMENT_ID ^
        --reason="DENIAL_REASON" ^
